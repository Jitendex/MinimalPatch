+HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK
 
+by William Shakespeare
 
-Actus Primus. Scoena Prima.
 
-Enter Barnardo and Francisco two Centinels.
 
-  Barnardo. Who's there?
-  Fran. Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold
-your selfe
-
-   Bar. Long liue the King
-
-   Fran. Barnardo?
-  Bar. He
-
-   Fran. You come most carefully vpon your houre
-
-   Bar. 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco
-
-   Fran. For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold,
-And I am sicke at heart
-
-   Barn. Haue you had quiet Guard?
-  Fran. Not a Mouse stirring
-
-   Barn. Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio and
-Marcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast.
-Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
-
-  Fran. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there?
-  Hor. Friends to this ground
-
-   Mar. And Leige-men to the Dane
-
-   Fran. Giue you good night
-
-   Mar. O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you?
-  Fra. Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight.
-
-Exit Fran.
-
-  Mar. Holla Barnardo
-
-   Bar. Say, what is Horatio there?
-  Hor. A peece of him
-
-   Bar. Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus
-
-   Mar. What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night
-
-   Bar. I haue seene nothing
-
-   Mar. Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie,
-And will not let beleefe take hold of him
-Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs,
-Therefore I haue intreated him along
-With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night,
-That if againe this Apparition come,
-He may approue our eyes, and speake to it
-
-   Hor. Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare
-
-   Bar. Sit downe a-while,
-And let vs once againe assaile your eares,
-That are so fortified against our Story,
-What we two Nights haue seene
-
-   Hor. Well, sit we downe,
-And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this
-
-   Barn. Last night of all,
-When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole
-Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen
-Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe,
-The Bell then beating one
-
-   Mar. Peace, breake thee of:
-Enter the Ghost.
-
-Looke where it comes againe
-
-   Barn. In the same figure, like the King that's dead
-
-   Mar. Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio
-
-   Barn. Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio
-
-   Hora. Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder
-  Barn. It would be spoke too
-
-   Mar. Question it Horatio
-
-   Hor. What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night,
-Together with that Faire and Warlike forme
-In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke
-Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake
-
-   Mar. It is offended
-
-   Barn. See, it stalkes away
-
-   Hor. Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake.
-
-Exit the Ghost.
-
-  Mar. 'Tis gone, and will not answer
-
-   Barn. How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale:
-Is not this something more then Fantasie?
-What thinke you on't?
-  Hor. Before my God, I might not this beleeue
-Without the sensible and true auouch
-Of mine owne eyes
-
-   Mar. Is it not like the King?
-  Hor. As thou art to thy selfe,
-Such was the very Armour he had on,
-When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted:
-So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle
-He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice.
-'Tis strange
-
-   Mar. Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre,
-With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch
-
-   Hor. In what particular thought to work, I know not:
-But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion,
-This boades some strange erruption to our State
-
-   Mar. Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes
-Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch,
-So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land,
-And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
-And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre:
-Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske
-Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke,
-What might be toward, that this sweaty hast
-Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day:
-Who is't that can informe me?
-  Hor. That can I,
-At least the whisper goes so: Our last King,
-Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs,
-Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway,
-(Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride)
-Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet,
-(For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
-Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact,
-Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie,
-Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands
-Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror:
-Against the which, a Moity competent
-Was gaged by our King: which had return'd
-To the Inheritance of Fortinbras,
-Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant
-And carriage of the Article designe,
-His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras,
-Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full,
-Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there,
-Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes,
-For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize
-That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
-(And it doth well appeare vnto our State)
-But to recouer of vs by strong hand
-And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands
-So by his Father lost: and this (I take it)
-Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations,
-The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head
-Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land.
-Enter Ghost againe.
-
-But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe:
-Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion:
-If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce,
-Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done,
-That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me.
-If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
-(Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake.
-Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life
-Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth,
-(For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death)
-Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus
-
-   Mar. Shall I strike at it with my Partizan?
-  Hor. Do, if it will not stand
-
-   Barn. 'Tis heere
-
-   Hor. 'Tis heere
-
-   Mar. 'Tis gone.
-
-Exit Ghost.
-
-We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall
-To offer it the shew of Violence,
-For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable,
-And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery
-
-   Barn. It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew
-
-   Hor. And then it started, like a guilty thing
-Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard,
-The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day,
-Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate
-Awake the God of Day: and at his warning,
-Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre,
-Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes
-To his Confine. And of the truth heerein,
-This present Obiect made probation
-
-   Mar. It faded on the crowing of the Cocke.
-Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes
-Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated,
-The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long:
-And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad,
-The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike,
-No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme:
-So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time
-
-   Hor. So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it.
-But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad,
-Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill,
-Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice
-Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
-Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life,
-This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him:
-Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
-As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty?
-  Mar. Let do't I pray, and I this morning know
-Where we shall finde him most conueniently.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Scena Secunda.
-
-Enter Claudius King of Denmarke, Gertrude the Queene, Hamlet,
-Polonius,
-Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant.
-
-  King. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death
-The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted
-To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome
-To be contracted in one brow of woe:
-Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature,
-That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him,
-Together with remembrance of our selues.
-Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene,
-Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State,
-Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
-With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye,
-With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage,
-In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole
-Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
-Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone
-With this affaire along, for all our Thankes.
-Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras,
-Holding a weake supposall of our worth;
-Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death,
-Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame,
-Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage;
-He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message,
-Importing the surrender of those Lands
-Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law
-To our most valiant Brother. So much for him.
-Enter Voltemand and Cornelius.
-
-Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
-Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ
-To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras,
-Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares
-Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse
-His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies,
-The Lists, and full proportions are all made
-Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
-You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand,
-For bearing of this greeting to old Norway,
-Giuing to you no further personall power
-To businesse with the King, more then the scope
-Of these dilated Articles allow:
-Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty
-
-   Volt. In that, and all things, will we shew our duty
-
-   King. We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell.
-
-Exit Voltemand and Cornelius.
-
-And now Laertes, what's the newes with you?
-You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes?
-You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane,
-And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes,
-That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking?
-The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart,
-The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth,
-Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father.
-What would'st thou haue Laertes?
-  Laer. Dread my Lord,
-Your leaue and fauour to returne to France,
-From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke
-To shew my duty in your Coronation,
-Yet now I must confesse, that duty done,
-My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France,
-And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon
-
-   King. Haue you your Fathers leaue?
-What sayes Pollonius?
-  Pol. He hath my Lord:
-I do beseech you giue him leaue to go
-
-   King. Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine,
-And thy best graces spend it at thy will:
-But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne?
-  Ham. A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde
-
-   King. How is it that the Clouds still hang on you?
-  Ham. Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun
-
-   Queen. Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off,
-And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke.
-Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
-Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust;
-Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye,
-Passing through Nature, to Eternity
-
-   Ham. I Madam, it is common
-
-   Queen. If it be;
-Why seemes it so particular with thee
-
-   Ham. Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes:
-'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother)
-Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke,
-Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
-No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye,
-Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage,
-Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe,
-That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme,
-For they are actions that a man might play:
-But I haue that Within, which passeth show;
-These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe
-
-   King. 'Tis sweet and commendable
-In your Nature Hamlet,
-To giue these mourning duties to your Father:
-But you must know, your Father lost a Father,
-That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound
-In filiall Obligation, for some terme
-To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer
-In obstinate Condolement, is a course
-Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe,
-It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen,
-A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient,
-An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd:
-For, what we know must be, and is as common
-As any the most vulgar thing to sence,
-Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
-Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen,
-A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature,
-To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame
-Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried,
-From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day,
-This must be so. We pray you throw to earth
-This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs
-As of a Father; For let the world take note,
-You are the most immediate to our Throne,
-And with no lesse Nobility of Loue,
-Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne,
-Do I impart towards you. For your intent
-In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg,
-It is most retrograde to our desire:
-And we beseech you, bend you to remaine
-Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye,
-Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne
-
-   Qu. Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet:
-I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg
-
-   Ham. I shall in all my best
-Obey you Madam
-
-   King. Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply,
-Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come,
-This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet
-Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,
-No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day,
-But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell,
-And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe,
-Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Manet Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt,
-Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew:
-Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt
-His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God!
-How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable
-Seemes to me all the vses of this world?
-Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden
-That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature
-Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this:
-But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two,
-So excellent a King, that was to this
-Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother,
-That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
-Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth
-Must I remember: why she would hang on him,
-As if encrease of Appetite had growne
-By what is fed on; and yet within a month?
-Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman.
-A little Month, or ere those shooes were old,
-With which she followed my poore Fathers body
-Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she.
-(O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason
-Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle,
-My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father,
-Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth?
-Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
-Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes,
-She married. O most wicked speed, to post
-With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets:
-It is not, nor it cannot come to good.
-But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue.
-Enter Horatio, Barnardo, and Marcellus.
-
-  Hor. Haile to your Lordship
-
-   Ham. I am glad to see you well:
-Horatio, or I do forget my selfe
-
-   Hor. The same my Lord,
-And your poore Seruant euer
-
-   Ham. Sir my good friend,
-Ile change that name with you:
-And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio?
-Marcellus
-
-   Mar. My good Lord
-
-   Ham. I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir.
-But what in faith make you from Wittemberge?
-  Hor. A truant disposition, good my Lord
-
-   Ham. I would not haue your Enemy say so;
-Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence,
-To make it truster of your owne report
-Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant:
-But what is your affaire in Elsenour?
-Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart
-
-   Hor. My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall
-
-   Ham. I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student)
-I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding
-
-   Hor. Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon
-
-   Ham. Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats
-Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables;
-Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen,
-Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio.
-My father, me thinkes I see my father
-
-   Hor. Oh where my Lord?
-  Ham. In my minds eye (Horatio)
-  Hor. I saw him once; he was a goodly King
-
-   Ham. He was a man, take him for all in all:
-I shall not look vpon his like againe
-
-   Hor. My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight
-
-   Ham. Saw? Who?
-  Hor. My Lord, the King your Father
-
-   Ham. The King my Father?
-  Hor. Season your admiration for a while
-With an attent eare; till I may deliuer
-Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen,
-This maruell to you
-
-   Ham. For Heauens loue let me heare
-
-   Hor. Two nights together, had these Gentlemen
-(Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch
-In the dead wast and middle of the night
-Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father,
-Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe,
-Appeares before them, and with sollemne march
-Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt,
-By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes,
-Within his Truncheons length; whilst they bestil'd
-Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare,
-Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me
-In dreadfull secrecie impart they did,
-And I with them the third Night kept the Watch,
-Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time,
-Forme of the thing; each word made true and good,
-The Apparition comes. I knew your Father:
-These hands are not more like
-
-   Ham. But where was this?
-  Mar. My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht
-
-   Ham. Did you not speake to it?
-  Hor. My Lord, I did;
-But answere made it none: yet once me thought
-It lifted vp it head, and did addresse
-It selfe to motion, like as it would speake:
-But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd;
-And at the sound it shrunke in hast away,
-And vanisht from our sight
-
-   Ham. Tis very strange
-
-   Hor. As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true;
-And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty
-To let you know of it
-
-   Ham. Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me.
-Hold you the watch to Night?
-  Both. We doe my Lord
-
-   Ham. Arm'd, say you?
-  Both. Arm'd, my Lord
-
-   Ham. From top to toe?
-  Both. My Lord, from head to foote
-
-   Ham. Then saw you not his face?
-  Hor. O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp
-
-   Ham. What, lookt he frowningly?
-  Hor. A countenance more in sorrow then in anger
-
-   Ham. Pale, or red?
-  Hor. Nay very pale
-
-   Ham. And fixt his eyes vpon you?
-  Hor. Most constantly
-
-   Ham. I would I had beene there
-
-   Hor. It would haue much amaz'd you
-
-   Ham. Very like, very like: staid it long?
-  Hor. While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred
-
-   All. Longer, longer
-
-   Hor. Not when I saw't
-
-   Ham. His Beard was grisly? no
-
-   Hor. It was, as I haue seene it in his life,
-A Sable Siluer'd
 
-   Ham. Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe
+PERSONS REPRESENTED.
 
-   Hor. I warrant you it will
-
-   Ham. If it assume my noble Fathers person,
-Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape
-And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
-If you haue hitherto conceald this sight;
-Let it bee treble in your silence still:
-And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night,
-Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue;
-I will requite your loues; so fare ye well:
-Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue,
-Ile visit you
-
-   All. Our duty to your Honour.
-
-Exeunt
-
-   Ham. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell.
-My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well:
-I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come;
-Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise,
-Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies.
-Enter.
-
-
-Scena Tertia
-
-
-Enter Laertes and Ophelia.
-
-  Laer. My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell:
-And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit,
-And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe,
-But let me heare from you
-
-   Ophel. Doe you doubt that?
-  Laer. For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours,
-Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude;
-A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature;
-Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting
-The suppliance of a minute? No more
-
-   Ophel. No more but so
-
-   Laer. Thinke it no more:
-For nature cressant does not grow alone,
-In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes,
-The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule
-Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now,
-And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
-The vertue of his feare: but you must feare
-His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne;
-For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth:
-Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe,
-Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends
-The sanctity and health of the whole State.
-And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd
-Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body,
-Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you,
-It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it;
-As he in his peculiar Sect and force
-May giue his saying deed: which is no further,
-Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall.
-Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine,
-If with too credent eare you list his Songs;
-Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open
-To his vnmastred importunity.
-Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister,
-And keepe within the reare of your Affection;
-Out of the shot and danger of Desire.
-The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough,
-If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone:
-Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes,
-The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring
-Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd,
-And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth,
-Contagious blastments are most imminent.
-Be wary then, best safety lies in feare;
-Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere

-Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele:
-But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment
-Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware
-Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in
-Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee.
-Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce:
-Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement:
-Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy;
-But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie:
-For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man.
-And they in France of the best ranck and station,
-Are of a most select and generous cheff in that.
-Neither a borrower, nor a lender be;
-For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend:
-And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry.
-This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true:
-And it must follow, as the Night the Day,
-Thou canst not then be false to any man.
-Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee
 
-   Laer. Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord
 
-   Polon. The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend
+ACT I.
 
-   Laer. Farewell Ophelia, and remember well
-What I haue said to you
+Scene I. Elsinore. A platform before the Castle.
 
-   Ophe. Tis in my memory lockt,
-And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it
-
-   Laer. Farewell.
-
-Exit Laer.
-
-  Polon. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you?
-  Ophe. So please you, somthing touching the L[ord]. Hamlet
-
-   Polon. Marry, well bethought:
-Tis told me he hath very oft of late
-Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe
-Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous.
-If it be so, as so tis put on me;
-And that in way of caution: I must tell you,
-You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely,
-As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour.
-What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth?
-  Ophe. He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders
-Of his affection to me
-
-   Polon. Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle,
-Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance.
-Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them?
-  Ophe. I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke
-
-   Polon. Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby,
-That you haue tane his tenders for true pay,
-Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly;
-Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase,
-Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole
-
-   Ophe. My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue,
-In honourable fashion
-
-   Polon. I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too
-
-   Ophe. And hath giuen countenance to his speech,
-My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen
-
-   Polon. I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know
-When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule
-Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter,
-Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both,
-Euen in their promise, as it is a making;
-You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter,
-Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence;
-Set your entreatments at a higher rate,
-Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
-Beleeue so much in him, that he is young,
-And with a larger tether may he walke,
-Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia,
-Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers,
-Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show:
-But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes,
-Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds,
-The better to beguile. This is for all:
-I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth,
-Haue you so slander any moment leisure,
-As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet:
-Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes
-
-   Ophe. I shall obey my Lord.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Hamlet, Horatio, Marcellus.
-
-  Ham. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold?
-  Hor. It is a nipping and an eager ayre
-
-   Ham. What hower now?
-  Hor. I thinke it lacks of twelue
-
-   Mar. No, it is strooke
-
-   Hor. Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season,
-Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke.
-What does this meane my Lord?
-  Ham. The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse,
-Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles,
-And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe,
-The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out
-The triumph of his Pledge
-
-   Horat. Is it a custome?
-  Ham. I marry ist;
-And to my mind, though I am natiue heere,
-And to the manner borne: It is a Custome
-More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance.
-Enter Ghost.
-
-  Hor. Looke my Lord, it comes
-
-   Ham. Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs:
-Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd,
-Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell,
-Be thy euents wicked or charitable,
-Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
-That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet,
-King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me,
-Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell
-Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death,
-Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher
-Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd,
-Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes,
-To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane?
-That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele,
-Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone,
-Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature,
-So horridly to shake our disposition,
-With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules,
-Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe?
+[Francisco at his post. Enter to him Bernardo.]
+
+Ber.
+Who's there?
+
+Fran.
+Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
+
+Ber.
+Long live the king!
+
+Fran.
+Bernardo?
+
+Ber.
+He.
+
+Fran.
+You come most carefully upon your hour.
+
+Ber.
+'Tis now struck twelve. Get thee to bed, Francisco.
+
+Fran.
+For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
+And I am sick at heart.
+
+Ber.
+Have you had quiet guard?
+
+Fran.
+Not a mouse stirring.
+
+Ber.
+Well, good night.
+If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
+The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
+
+Fran.
+I think I hear them.--Stand, ho! Who is there?
+
+[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
+
+Hor.
+Friends to this ground.
+
+Mar.
+And liegemen to the Dane.
+
+Fran.
+Give you good-night.
+
+Mar.
+O, farewell, honest soldier;
+Who hath reliev'd you?
+
+Fran.
+Bernardo has my place.
+Give you good-night.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Mar.
+Holla! Bernardo!
+
+Ber.
+Say.
+What, is Horatio there?
+
+Hor.
+A piece of him.
+
+Ber.
+Welcome, Horatio:--Welcome, good Marcellus.
+
+Mar.
+What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
+
+Ber.
+I have seen nothing.
+
+Mar.
+Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
+And will not let belief take hold of him
+Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
+Therefore I have entreated him along
+With us to watch the minutes of this night;
+That, if again this apparition come
+He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
+
+Hor.
+Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
+
+Ber.
+Sit down awhile,
+And let us once again assail your ears,
+That are so fortified against our story,
+What we two nights have seen.
+
+Hor.
+Well, sit we down,
+And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
+
+Ber.
+Last night of all,
+When yond same star that's westward from the pole
+Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
+Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
+The bell then beating one,--
+
+Mar.
+Peace, break thee off; look where it comes again!
+
+[Enter Ghost, armed.]
+
+Ber.
+In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
+
+Mar.
+Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
+
+Ber.
+Looks it not like the King? mark it, Horatio.
+
+Hor.
+Most like:--it harrows me with fear and wonder.
+
+Ber.
+It would be spoke to.
+
+Mar.
+Question it, Horatio.
+
+Hor.
+What art thou, that usurp'st this time of night,
+Together with that fair and warlike form
+In which the majesty of buried Denmark
+Did sometimes march? By heaven I charge thee, speak!
+
+Mar.
+It is offended.
+
+Ber.
+See, it stalks away!
+
+Hor.
+Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee speak!
+
+[Exit Ghost.]
+
+Mar.
+'Tis gone, and will not answer.
+
+Ber.
+How now, Horatio! You tremble and look pale:
+Is not this something more than fantasy?
+What think you on't?
+
+Hor.
+Before my God, I might not this believe
+Without the sensible and true avouch
+Of mine own eyes.
+
+Mar.
+Is it not like the King?
+
+Hor.
+As thou art to thyself:
+Such was the very armour he had on
+When he the ambitious Norway combated;
+So frown'd he once when, in an angry parle,
+He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
+'Tis strange.
+
+Mar.
+Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
+With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
+
+Hor.
+In what particular thought to work I know not;
+But, in the gross and scope of my opinion,
+This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
+
+Mar.
+Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
+Why this same strict and most observant watch
+So nightly toils the subject of the land;
+And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
+And foreign mart for implements of war;
+Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
+Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
+What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
+Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
+Who is't that can inform me?
+
+Hor.
+That can I;
+At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
+Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
+Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
+Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
+Dar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,--
+For so this side of our known world esteem'd him,--
+Did slay this Fortinbras; who, by a seal'd compact,
+Well ratified by law and heraldry,
+Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands,
+Which he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror:
+Against the which, a moiety competent
+Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
+To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
+Had he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant,
+And carriage of the article design'd,
+His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
+Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
+Hath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,
+Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
+For food and diet, to some enterprise
+That hath a stomach in't; which is no other,--
+As it doth well appear unto our state,--
+But to recover of us, by strong hand,
+And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
+So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
+Is the main motive of our preparations,
+The source of this our watch, and the chief head
+Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
+
+Ber.
+I think it be no other but e'en so:
+Well may it sort, that this portentous figure
+Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
+That was and is the question of these wars.
+
+Hor.
+A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
+In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
+A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
+The graves stood tenantless, and the sheeted dead
+Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;
+As, stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
+Disasters in the sun; and the moist star,
+Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,
+Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
+And even the like precurse of fierce events,--
+As harbingers preceding still the fates,
+And prologue to the omen coming on,--
+Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
+Unto our climature and countrymen.--
+But, soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
+
+[Re-enter Ghost.]
+
+I'll cross it, though it blast me.--Stay, illusion!
+If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
+Speak to me:
+If there be any good thing to be done,
+That may to thee do ease, and, race to me,
+Speak to me:
+If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
+Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid,
+O, speak!
+Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
+Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
+For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
+[The cock crows.]
+Speak of it:--stay, and speak!--Stop it, Marcellus!
+
+Mar.
+Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
+
+Hor.
+Do, if it will not stand.
+
+Ber.
+'Tis here!
+
+Hor.
+'Tis here!
+
+Mar.
+'Tis gone!
+
+[Exit Ghost.]
+
+We do it wrong, being so majestical,
+To offer it the show of violence;
+For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
+And our vain blows malicious mockery.
+
+Ber.
+It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
+
+Hor.
+And then it started, like a guilty thing
+Upon a fearful summons. I have heard
+The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
+Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
+Awake the god of day; and at his warning,
+Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
+The extravagant and erring spirit hies
+To his confine: and of the truth herein
+This present object made probation.
+
+Mar.
+It faded on the crowing of the cock.
+Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
+Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
+The bird of dawning singeth all night long;
+And then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad;
+The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
+No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;
+So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
+
+Hor.
+So have I heard, and do in part believe it.
+But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
+Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
+Break we our watch up: and by my advice,
+Let us impart what we have seen to-night
+Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
+This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him:
+Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
+As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
 
-Ghost beckens Hamlet.
+Mar.
+Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
+Where we shall find him most conveniently.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene II. Elsinore. A room of state in the Castle.
+
+[Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand,
+Cornelius, Lords, and Attendant.]
+
+King.
+Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
+The memory be green, and that it us befitted
+To bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom
+To be contracted in one brow of woe;
+Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
+That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
+Together with remembrance of ourselves.
+Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
+Th' imperial jointress to this warlike state,
+Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
+With an auspicious and one dropping eye,
+With mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,
+In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
+Taken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd
+Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
+With this affair along:--or all, our thanks.
+Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
+Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
+Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
+Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
+Colleagued with this dream of his advantage,
+He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
+Importing the surrender of those lands
+Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
+To our most valiant brother. So much for him,--
+Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
+Thus much the business is:--we have here writ
+To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
+Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
+Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
+His further gait herein; in that the levies,
+The lists, and full proportions are all made
+Out of his subject:--and we here dispatch
+You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
+For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
+Giving to you no further personal power
+To business with the king, more than the scope
+Of these dilated articles allow.
+Farewell; and let your haste commend your duty.
+
+Cor. and Volt.
+In that and all things will we show our duty.
+
+King.
+We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
+
+[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
+
+And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
+You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
+You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
+And lose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
+That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
+The head is not more native to the heart,
+The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
+Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
+What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
+
+Laer.
+Dread my lord,
+Your leave and favour to return to France;
+From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
+To show my duty in your coronation;
+Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
+My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,
+And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
+
+King.
+Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
+
+Pol.
+He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
+By laboursome petition; and at last
+Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
+I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
+
+King.
+Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
+And thy best graces spend it at thy will!--
+But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son--
+
+Ham.
+[Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind!
+
+King.
+How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
+
+Ham.
+Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
+
+Queen.
+Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
+And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
+Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
+Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
+Thou know'st 'tis common,--all that lives must die,
+Passing through nature to eternity.
+
+Ham.
+Ay, madam, it is common.
+
+Queen.
+If it be,
+Why seems it so particular with thee?
+
+Ham.
+Seems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.
+'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
+Nor customary suits of solemn black,
+Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,
+No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
+Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
+Together with all forms, moods, shows of grief,
+That can denote me truly: these, indeed, seem;
+For they are actions that a man might play;
+But I have that within which passeth show;
+These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
+
+King.
+'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
+To give these mourning duties to your father;
+But, you must know, your father lost a father;
+That father lost, lost his; and the survivor bound,
+In filial obligation, for some term
+To do obsequious sorrow: but to persevere
+In obstinate condolement is a course
+Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
+It shows a will most incorrect to heaven;
+A heart unfortified, a mind impatient;
+An understanding simple and unschool'd;
+For what we know must be, and is as common
+As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
+Why should we, in our peevish opposition,
+Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
+A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
+To reason most absurd; whose common theme
+Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
+From the first corse till he that died to-day,
+'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
+This unprevailing woe; and think of us
+As of a father: for let the world take note
+You are the most immediate to our throne;
+And with no less nobility of love
+Than that which dearest father bears his son
+Do I impart toward you. For your intent
+In going back to school in Wittenberg,
+It is most retrograde to our desire:
+And we beseech you bend you to remain
+Here in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
+Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
+
+Queen.
+Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
+I pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
+
+Ham.
+I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
+
+King.
+Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
+Be as ourself in Denmark.--Madam, come;
+This gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet
+Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
+No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day
+But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell;
+And the king's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,
+Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
+
+[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
+
+Ham.
+O that this too too solid flesh would melt,
+Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
+Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
+His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!
+How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
+Seem to me all the uses of this world!
+Fie on't! O fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
+That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
+Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
+But two months dead!--nay, not so much, not two:
+So excellent a king; that was, to this,
+Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother,
+That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
+Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
+Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him
+As if increase of appetite had grown
+By what it fed on: and yet, within a month,--
+Let me not think on't,--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
+A little month; or ere those shoes were old
+With which she followed my poor father's body
+Like Niobe, all tears;--why she, even she,--
+O God! a beast that wants discourse of reason,
+Would have mourn'd longer,--married with mine uncle,
+My father's brother; but no more like my father
+Than I to Hercules: within a month;
+Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
+Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
+She married:-- O, most wicked speed, to post
+With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
+It is not, nor it cannot come to good;
+But break my heart,--for I must hold my tongue!
+
+[Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
+
+Hor.
+Hail to your lordship!
+
+Ham.
+I am glad to see you well:
+Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
+
+Hor.
+The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
+
+Ham.
+Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
+And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--
+Marcellus?
+
+Mar.
+My good lord,--
+
+Ham.
+I am very glad to see you.--Good even, sir.--
+But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
+
+Hor.
+A truant disposition, good my lord.
+
+Ham.
+I would not hear your enemy say so;
+Nor shall you do my ear that violence,
+To make it truster of your own report
+Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
+But what is your affair in Elsinore?
+We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
+
+Hor.
+My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
+
+Ham.
+I prithee do not mock me, fellow-student.
+I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
+
+Hor.
+Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
+
+Ham.
+Thrift, thrift, Horatio! The funeral bak'd meats
+Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
+Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
+Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!--
+My father,--methinks I see my father.
+
+Hor.
+Where, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+In my mind's eye, Horatio.
+
+Hor.
+I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
+
+Ham.
+He was a man, take him for all in all,
+I shall not look upon his like again.
+
+Hor.
+My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
+
+Ham.
+Saw who?
+
+Hor.
+My lord, the king your father.
+
+Ham.
+The King my father!
+
+Hor.
+Season your admiration for awhile
+With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
+Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
+This marvel to you.
+
+Ham.
+For God's love let me hear.
+
+Hor.
+Two nights together had these gentlemen,
+Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch
+In the dead vast and middle of the night,
+Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
+Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
+Appears before them and with solemn march
+Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
+By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
+Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distill'd
+Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
+Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me
+In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
+And I with them the third night kept the watch:
+Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
+Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
+The apparition comes: I knew your father;
+These hands are not more like.
+
+Ham.
+But where was this?
+
+Mar.
+My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
+
+Ham.
+Did you not speak to it?
+
+Hor.
+My lord, I did;
+But answer made it none: yet once methought
+It lifted up it head, and did address
+Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
+But even then the morning cock crew loud,
+And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
+And vanish'd from our sight.
+
+Ham.
+'Tis very strange.
+
+Hor.
+As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
+And we did think it writ down in our duty
+To let you know of it.
+
+Ham.
+Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
+Hold you the watch to-night?
+
+Mar. and Ber.
+We do, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Arm'd, say you?
+
+Both.
+Arm'd, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+From top to toe?
+
+Both.
+My lord, from head to foot.
+
+Ham.
+Then saw you not his face?
+
+Hor.
+O, yes, my lord: he wore his beaver up.
+
+Ham.
+What, look'd he frowningly?
+
+Hor.
+A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
+
+Ham.
+Pale or red?
+
+Hor.
+Nay, very pale.
+
+Ham.
+And fix'd his eyes upon you?
+
+Hor.
+Most constantly.
+
+Ham.
+I would I had been there.
+
+Hor.
+It would have much amaz'd you.
+
+Ham.
+Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
+
+Hor.
+While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
+
+Mar. and Ber.
+Longer, longer.
+
+Hor.
+Not when I saw't.
+
+Ham.
+His beard was grizzled,--no?
+
+Hor.
+It was, as I have seen it in his life,
+A sable silver'd.
+
+Ham.
+I will watch to-night;
+Perchance 'twill walk again.
+
+Hor.
+I warr'nt it will.
+
+Ham.
+If it assume my noble father's person,
+I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
+And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
+If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
+Let it be tenable in your silence still;
+And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
+Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
+I will requite your loves. So, fare ye well:
+Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
+I'll visit you.
+
+All.
+Our duty to your honour.
+
+Ham.
+Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
+
+[Exeunt Horatio, Marcellus, and Bernardo.]
+
+My father's spirit in arms! All is not well;
+I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
+Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
+Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+
+
+Scene III. A room in Polonius's house.
+
+[Enter Laertes and Ophelia.]
+
+Laer.
+My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
+And, sister, as the winds give benefit
+And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
+But let me hear from you.
+
+Oph.
+Do you doubt that?
+
+Laer.
+For Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,
+Hold it a fashion, and a toy in blood:
+A violet in the youth of primy nature,
+Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;
+The perfume and suppliance of a minute;
+No more.
+
+Oph.
+No more but so?
+
+Laer.
+Think it no more:
+For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
+In thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,
+The inward service of the mind and soul
+Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now;
+And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
+The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
+His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
+For he himself is subject to his birth:
+He may not, as unvalu'd persons do,
+Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
+The safety and health of this whole state;
+And therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd
+Unto the voice and yielding of that body
+Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
+It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
+As he in his particular act and place
+May give his saying deed; which is no further
+Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
+Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain
+If with too credent ear you list his songs,
+Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
+To his unmaster'd importunity.
+Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;
+And keep you in the rear of your affection,
+Out of the shot and danger of desire.
+The chariest maid is prodigal enough
+If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
+Virtue itself scopes not calumnious strokes:
+The canker galls the infants of the spring
+Too oft before their buttons be disclos'd:
+And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
+Contagious blastments are most imminent.
+Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
+Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
 
-  Hor. It beckons you to goe away with it,
-As if it some impartment did desire
-To you alone
+Oph.
+I shall th' effect of this good lesson keep
+As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
+Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
+Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
+Whilst, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
+Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads
+And recks not his own read.
+
+Laer.
+O, fear me not.
+I stay too long:--but here my father comes.
 
-   Mar. Looke with what courteous action
-It wafts you to a more remoued ground:
-But doe not goe with it
-
-   Hor. No, by no meanes
-
-   Ham. It will not speake: then will I follow it
-
-   Hor. Doe not my Lord
-
-   Ham. Why, what should be the feare?
-I doe not set my life at a pins fee;
-And for my Soule, what can it doe to that?
-Being a thing immortall as it selfe:
-It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it
-
-   Hor. What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord?
-Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe,
-That beetles o're his base into the Sea,
-And there assumes some other horrible forme,
-Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason,
-And draw you into madnesse thinke of it?
-  Ham. It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee
-
-   Mar. You shall not goe my Lord
-
-   Ham. Hold off your hand
-
-   Hor. Be rul'd, you shall not goe
-
-   Ham. My fate cries out,
-And makes each petty Artire in this body,
-As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue:
-Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen:
-By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me:
-I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee.
-
-Exeunt. Ghost & Hamlet.
-
-  Hor. He waxes desperate with imagination
-
-   Mar. Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him
-
-   Hor. Haue after, to what issue will this come?
-  Mar. Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke
-
-   Hor. Heauen will direct it
-
-   Mar. Nay, let's follow him.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Ghost and Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further
-
-   Gho. Marke me
-
-   Ham. I will
-
-   Gho. My hower is almost come,
-When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames
-Must render vp my selfe
-
-   Ham. Alas poore Ghost
-
-   Gho. Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing
-To what I shall vnfold
-
-   Ham. Speake, I am bound to heare
-
-   Gho. So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare
-
-   Ham. What?
-  Gho. I am thy Fathers Spirit,
-Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night;
-And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers,
-Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature
-Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid
-To tell the secrets of my Prison-House;
-I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word
-Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood,
-Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres,
-Thy knotty and combined lockes to part,
-And each particular haire to stand an end,
-Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine:
-But this eternall blason must not be
-To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list,
-If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue
-
-   Ham. Oh Heauen!
-  Gho. Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther
-
-   Ham. Murther?
-  Ghost. Murther most foule, as in the best it is;
-But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall
-
-   Ham. Hast, hast me to know it,
-That with wings as swift
-As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue,
-May sweepe to my Reuenge
-
-   Ghost. I finde thee apt,
-And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede
-That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe,
-Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare:
-It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard,
-A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke,
-Is by a forged processe of my death
-Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth,
-The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life,
-Now weares his Crowne
-
-   Ham. O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle?
-  Ghost. I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast
-With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts.
-Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power
-So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust
-The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene:
-Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there,
-From me, whose loue was of that dignity,
-That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow
-I made to her in Marriage; and to decline
-Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore
-To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued,
-Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen:
-So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd,
-Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage.
-But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre;
-Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard,
-My custome alwayes in the afternoone;
-Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
-With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl,
-And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
-The leaperous Distilment; whose effect
-Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man,
-That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through
-The naturall Gates and Allies of the body;
-And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
-And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke,
-The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine;
-And a most instant Tetter bak'd about,
-Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
-All my smooth Body.
-Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand,
-Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht;
-Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne,
-Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld,
-No reckoning made, but sent to my account
-With all my imperfections on my head;
-Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible:
-If thou hast nature in thee beare it not;
-Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
-A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest.
-But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act,
-Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue
-Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen,
-And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge,
-To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once;
-The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere,
-And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire:
-Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me.
-Enter.
-
-  Ham. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els?
-And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart;
-And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old;
-But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee?
-I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate
-In this distracted Globe: Remember thee?
-Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
-Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
-All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past,
-That youth and obseruation coppied there;
-And thy Commandment all alone shall liue
-Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
-Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen:
-Oh most pernicious woman!
-Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine!
-My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe,
-That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine;
-At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke;
-So Vnckle there you are: now to my word;
-It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't
-
-   Hor. & Mar. within. My Lord, my Lord.
-Enter Horatio and Marcellus.
-
-  Mar. Lord Hamlet
-
-   Hor. Heauen secure him
-
-   Mar. So be it
-
-   Hor. Illo, ho, ho, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come
-
-   Mar. How ist my Noble Lord?
-  Hor. What newes, my Lord?
-  Ham. Oh wonderfull!
-  Hor. Good my Lord tell it
-
-   Ham. No you'l reueale it
-
-   Hor. Not I, my Lord, by Heauen
-
-   Mar. Nor I, my Lord
-
-   Ham. How say you then, would heart of man once think it?
-But you'l be secret?
-  Both. I, by Heau'n, my Lord
+[Enter Polonius.]
 
-   Ham. There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke
-But hee's an arrant knaue
+A double blessing is a double grace;
+Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
 
-   Hor. There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the
-Graue, to tell vs this
+Pol.
+Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
+The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
+And you are stay'd for. There,--my blessing with thee!
+
+[Laying his hand on Laertes's head.]
+
+And these few precepts in thy memory
+Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
+Nor any unproportion'd thought his act.
+Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
+Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
+Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;
+But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
+Of each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware
+Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
+Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
+Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
+Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
+Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
+But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
+For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
+And they in France of the best rank and station
+Are most select and generous chief in that.
+Neither a borrower nor a lender be:
+For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
+And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
+This above all,--to thine own self be true;
+And it must follow, as the night the day,
+Thou canst not then be false to any man.
+Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
 
-   Ham. Why right, you are i'th' right;
-And so, without more circumstance at all,
-I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part:
-You, as your busines and desires shall point you:
-For euery man ha's businesse and desire,
-Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part,
-Looke you, Ile goe pray
+Laer.
+Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
 
-   Hor. These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord
+Pol.
+The time invites you; go, your servants tend.
 
-   Ham. I'm sorry they offend you heartily:
-Yes faith, heartily
+Laer.
+Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
+What I have said to you.
+
+Oph.
+'Tis in my memory lock'd,
+And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
+
+Laer.
+Farewell.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Pol.
+What is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?
+
+Oph.
+So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
+
+Pol.
+Marry, well bethought:
+'Tis told me he hath very oft of late
+Given private time to you; and you yourself
+Have of your audience been most free and bounteous;
+If it be so,--as so 'tis put on me,
+And that in way of caution,--I must tell you
+You do not understand yourself so clearly
+As it behooves my daughter and your honour.
+What is between you? give me up the truth.
+
+Oph.
+He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
+Of his affection to me.
+
+Pol.
+Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
+Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
+Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
+
+Oph.
+I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
+
+Pol.
+Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
+That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
+Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
+Or,--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
+Wronging it thus,--you'll tender me a fool.
+
+Oph.
+My lord, he hath importun'd me with love
+In honourable fashion.
+
+Pol.
+Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
+
+Oph.
+And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
+With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
+
+Pol.
+Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
+When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
+Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
+Giving more light than heat,--extinct in both,
+Even in their promise, as it is a-making,--
+You must not take for fire. From this time
+Be something scanter of your maiden presence;
+Set your entreatments at a higher rate
+Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
+Believe so much in him, that he is young;
+And with a larger tether may he walk
+Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
+Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,--
+Not of that dye which their investments show,
+But mere implorators of unholy suits,
+Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
+The better to beguile. This is for all,--
+I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth
+Have you so slander any moment leisure
+As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
+Look to't, I charge you; come your ways.
+
+Oph.
+I shall obey, my lord.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene IV. The platform.
+
+[Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.]
+
+Ham.
+The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
+
+Hor.
+It is a nipping and an eager air.
+
+Ham.
+What hour now?
+
+Hor.
+I think it lacks of twelve.
+
+Mar.
+No, it is struck.
+
+Hor.
+Indeed? I heard it not: then draws near the season
+Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
+
+[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off within.]
+
+What does this mean, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+The King doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
+Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
+And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
+The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
+The triumph of his pledge.
+
+Hor.
+Is it a custom?
+
+Ham.
+Ay, marry, is't;
+But to my mind,--though I am native here,
+And to the manner born,--it is a custom
+More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
+This heavy-headed revel east and west
+Makes us traduc'd and tax'd of other nations:
+They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
+Soil our addition; and, indeed, it takes
+From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
+The pith and marrow of our attribute.
+So oft it chances in particular men
+That, for some vicious mole of nature in them,
+As in their birth,--wherein they are not guilty,
+Since nature cannot choose his origin,--
+By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
+Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;
+Or by some habit, that too much o'er-leavens
+The form of plausive manners;--that these men,--
+Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
+Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
+Their virtues else,--be they as pure as grace,
+As infinite as man may undergo,--
+Shall in the general censure take corruption
+From that particular fault: the dram of eale
+Doth all the noble substance often doubt
+To his own scandal.
+
+Hor.
+Look, my lord, it comes!
+
+[Enter Ghost.]
+
+Ham.
+Angels and ministers of grace defend us!--
+Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
+Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
+Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
+Thou com'st in such a questionable shape
+That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
+King, father, royal Dane; O, answer me!
+Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
+Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
+Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
+Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
+Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
+To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
+That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,
+Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
+Making night hideous, and we fools of nature
+So horridly to shake our disposition
+With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
+Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
 
-   Hor. There's no offence my Lord
+[Ghost beckons Hamlet.]
 
-   Ham. Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord,
-And much offence too, touching this Vision heere:
-It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you:
-For your desire to know what is betweene vs,
-O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends,
-As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers,
-Giue me one poore request
+Hor.
+It beckons you to go away with it,
+As if it some impartment did desire
+To you alone.
 
-   Hor. What is't my Lord? we will
+Mar.
+Look with what courteous action
+It waves you to a more removed ground:
+But do not go with it!
+
+Hor.
+No, by no means.
+
+Ham.
+It will not speak; then will I follow it.
+
+Hor.
+Do not, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Why, what should be the fear?
+I do not set my life at a pin's fee;
+And for my soul, what can it do to that,
+Being a thing immortal as itself?
+It waves me forth again;--I'll follow it.
+
+Hor.
+What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
+Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
+That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
+And there assume some other horrible form
+Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason,
+And draw you into madness? think of it:
+The very place puts toys of desperation,
+Without more motive, into every brain
+That looks so many fadoms to the sea
+And hears it roar beneath.
+
+Ham.
+It waves me still.--
+Go on; I'll follow thee.
+
+Mar.
+You shall not go, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Hold off your hands.
+
+Hor.
+Be rul'd; you shall not go.
+
+Ham.
+My fate cries out,
+And makes each petty artery in this body
+As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.--
+
+[Ghost beckons.]
+
+Still am I call'd;--unhand me, gentlemen;--
+
+[Breaking free from them.]
+
+By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!--
+I say, away!--Go on; I'll follow thee.
+
+[Exeunt Ghost and Hamlet.]
+
+Hor.
+He waxes desperate with imagination.
+
+Mar.
+Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
+
+Hor.
+Have after.--To what issue will this come?
+
+Mar.
+Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
+
+Hor.
+Heaven will direct it.
+
+Mar.
+Nay, let's follow him.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene V. A more remote part of the Castle.
+
+[Enter Ghost and Hamlet.]
+
+Ham.
+Whither wilt thou lead me? speak! I'll go no further.
+
+Ghost.
+Mark me.
+
+Ham.
+I will.
+
+Ghost.
+My hour is almost come,
+When I to sulph'uous and tormenting flames
+Must render up myself.
+
+Ham.
+Alas, poor ghost!
+
+Ghost.
+Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
+To what I shall unfold.
+
+Ham.
+Speak; I am bound to hear.
+
+Ghost.
+So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
+
+Ham.
+What?
+
+Ghost.
+I am thy father's spirit;
+Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
+And for the day confin'd to wastein fires,
+Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
+Are burnt and purg'd away. But that I am forbid
+To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
+I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
+Would harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood;
+Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;
+Thy knotted and combined locks to part,
+And each particular hair to stand on end
+Like quills upon the fretful porcupine:
+But this eternal blazon must not be
+To ears of flesh and blood.--List, list, O, list!--
+If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
+
+Ham.
+O God!
+
+Ghost.
+Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
+
+Ham.
+Murder!
+
+Ghost.
+Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
+But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.
+
+Ham.
+Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
+As meditation or the thoughts of love,
+May sweep to my revenge.
+
+Ghost.
+I find thee apt;
+And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
+That rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
+Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.
+'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
+A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
+Is by a forged process of my death
+Rankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,
+The serpent that did sting thy father's life
+Now wears his crown.
+
+Ham.
+O my prophetic soul!
+Mine uncle!
+
+Ghost.
+Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
+With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
+O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
+So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
+The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
+O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
+From me, whose love was of that dignity
+That it went hand in hand even with the vow
+I made to her in marriage; and to decline
+Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
+To those of mine!
+But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,
+Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;
+So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
+Will sate itself in a celestial bed
+And prey on garbage.
+But soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
+Brief let me be.--Sleeping within my orchard,
+My custom always of the afternoon,
+Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
+With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
+And in the porches of my ears did pour
+The leperous distilment; whose effect
+Holds such an enmity with blood of man
+That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through
+The natural gates and alleys of the body;
+And with a sudden vigour it doth posset
+And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
+The thin and wholesome blood; so did it mine;
+And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
+Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust
+All my smooth body.
+Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,
+Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
+Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
+Unhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;
+No reckoning made, but sent to my account
+With all my imperfections on my head:
+O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
+If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
+Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
+A couch for luxury and damned incest.
+But, howsoever thou pursu'st this act,
+Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
+Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven,
+And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
+To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
+The glowworm shows the matin to be near,
+And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
+Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Ham.
+O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
+And shall I couple hell? O, fie!--Hold, my heart;
+And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
+But bear me stiffly up.--Remember thee!
+Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
+In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
+Yea, from the table of my memory
+I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
+All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
+That youth and observation copied there;
+And thy commandment all alone shall live
+Within the book and volume of my brain,
+Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!--
+O most pernicious woman!
+O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
+My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
+That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
+At least, I am sure, it may be so in Denmark:
+
+[Writing.]
+
+So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
+It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me:'
+I have sworn't.
+
+Hor.
+[Within.] My lord, my lord,--
+
+Mar.
+[Within.] Lord Hamlet,--
+
+Hor.
+[Within.] Heaven secure him!
+
+Ham.
+So be it!
+
+Mar.
+[Within.] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!
+
+Ham.
+Hillo, ho, ho, boy! Come, bird, come.
+
+[Enter Horatio and Marcellus.]
+
+Mar.
+How is't, my noble lord?
+
+Hor.
+What news, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+O, wonderful!
+
+Hor.
+Good my lord, tell it.
+
+Ham.
+No; you'll reveal it.
+
+Hor.
+Not I, my lord, by heaven.
+
+Mar.
+Nor I, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+How say you then; would heart of man once think it?--
+But you'll be secret?
+
+Hor. and Mar.
+Ay, by heaven, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
+But he's an arrant knave.
+
+Hor.
+There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
+To tell us this.
 
-   Ham. Neuer make known what you haue seen to night
+Ham.
+Why, right; you are i' the right;
+And so, without more circumstance at all,
+I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
+You, as your business and desires shall point you,--
+For every man hath business and desire,
+Such as it is;--and for my own poor part,
+Look you, I'll go pray.
+
+Hor.
+These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
+Yes, faith, heartily.
+
+Hor.
+There's no offence, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
+And much offence too. Touching this vision here,--
+It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
+For your desire to know what is between us,
+O'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,
+As you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,
+Give me one poor request.
+
+Hor.
+What is't, my lord? we will.
+
+Ham.
+Never make known what you have seen to-night.
+
+Hor. and Mar.
+My lord, we will not.
+
+Ham.
+Nay, but swear't.
+
+Hor.
+In faith,
+My lord, not I.
+
+Mar.
+Nor I, my lord, in faith.
+
+Ham.
+Upon my sword.
+
+Mar.
+We have sworn, my lord, already.
+
+Ham.
+Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
+
+Ghost.
+[Beneath.] Swear.
+
+Ham.
+Ha, ha boy! say'st thou so? art thou there, truepenny?--
+Come on!--you hear this fellow in the cellarage,--
+Consent to swear.
+
+Hor.
+Propose the oath, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Never to speak of this that you have seen,
+Swear by my sword.
+
+Ghost.
+[Beneath.] Swear.
+
+Ham.
+Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.--
+Come hither, gentlemen,
+And lay your hands again upon my sword:
+Never to speak of this that you have heard,
+Swear by my sword.
+
+Ghost.
+[Beneath.] Swear.
+
+Ham.
+Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
+A worthy pioner!--Once more remove, good friends.
+
+Hor.
+O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
+
+Ham.
+And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
+There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
+Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
+But come;--
+Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
+How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,--
+As I, perchance, hereafter shall think meet
+To put an antic disposition on,--
+That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
+With arms encumber'd thus, or this head-shake,
+Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
+As 'Well, well, we know'; or 'We could, an if we would';--
+Or 'If we list to speak'; or 'There be, an if they might';--
+Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
+That you know aught of me:--this is not to do,
+So grace and mercy at your most need help you,
+Swear.
+
+Ghost.
+[Beneath.] Swear.
+
+Ham.
+Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!--So, gentlemen,
+With all my love I do commend me to you:
+And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
+May do, to express his love and friending to you,
+God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
+And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
+The time is out of joint:--O cursed spite,
+That ever I was born to set it right!--
+Nay, come, let's go together.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Act II.
+
+Scene I. A room in Polonius's house.
+
+[Enter Polonius and Reynaldo.]
+
+Pol.
+Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
+
+Rey.
+I will, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
+Before You visit him, to make inquiry
+Of his behaviour.
 
-   Both. My Lord, we will not
+Rey.
+My lord, I did intend it.
 
-   Ham. Nay, but swear't
+Pol.
+Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
+Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
+And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
+What company, at what expense; and finding,
+By this encompassment and drift of question,
+That they do know my son, come you more nearer
+Than your particular demands will touch it:
+Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
+As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
+And in part him;--do you mark this, Reynaldo?
+
+Rey.
+Ay, very well, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+'And in part him;--but,' you may say, 'not well:
+But if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
+Addicted so and so;' and there put on him
+What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
+As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
+But, sir, such wanton, wild, and usual slips
+As are companions noted and most known
+To youth and liberty.
+
+Rey.
+As gaming, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
+Drabbing:--you may go so far.
+
+Rey.
+My lord, that would dishonour him.
+
+Pol.
+Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge.
+You must not put another scandal on him,
+That he is open to incontinency;
+That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
+That they may seem the taints of liberty;
+The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind;
+A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
+Of general assault.
+
+Rey.
+But, my good lord,--
+
+Pol.
+Wherefore should you do this?
+
+Rey.
+Ay, my lord,
+I would know that.
+
+Pol.
+Marry, sir, here's my drift;
+And I believe it is a fetch of warrant:
+You laying these slight sullies on my son
+As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working,
+Mark you,
+Your party in converse, him you would sound,
+Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
+The youth you breathe of guilty, be assur'd
+He closes with you in this consequence;
+'Good sir,' or so; or 'friend,' or 'gentleman'--
+According to the phrase or the addition
+Of man and country.
+
+Rey.
+Very good, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+And then, sir, does he this,--he does--What was I about to say?--
+By the mass, I was about to say something:--Where did I leave?
+
+Rey.
+At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,' and
+gentleman.'
+
+Pol.
+At--closes in the consequence'--ay, marry!
+He closes with you thus:--'I know the gentleman;
+I saw him yesterday, or t'other day,
+Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
+There was he gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
+There falling out at tennis': or perchance,
+'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'--
+Videlicet, a brothel,--or so forth.--
+See you now;
+Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
+And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
+With windlaces, and with assays of bias,
+By indirections find directions out:
+So, by my former lecture and advice,
+Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
+
+Rey.
+My lord, I have.
+
+Pol.
+God b' wi' you, fare you well.
+
+Rey.
+Good my lord!
+
+Pol.
+Observe his inclination in yourself.
+
+Rey.
+I shall, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+And let him ply his music.
+
+Rey.
+Well, my lord.
+
+Pol.
+Farewell!
+
+[Exit Reynaldo.]
+
+[Enter Ophelia.]
+
+How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
+
+Oph.
+Alas, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
+
+Pol.
+With what, i' the name of God?
+
+Oph.
+My lord, as I was sewing in my chamber,
+Lord Hamlet,--with his doublet all unbrac'd;
+No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
+Ungart'red, and down-gyved to his ankle;
+Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
+And with a look so piteous in purport
+As if he had been loosed out of hell
+To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
+
+Pol.
+Mad for thy love?
+
+Oph.
+My lord, I do not know;
+But truly I do fear it.
+
+Pol.
+What said he?
+
+Oph.
+He took me by the wrist, and held me hard;
+Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
+And with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
+He falls to such perusal of my face
+As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
+At last,--a little shaking of mine arm,
+And thrice his head thus waving up and down,--
+He rais'd a sigh so piteous and profound
+As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
+And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
+And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd
+He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
+For out o' doors he went without their help,
+And to the last bended their light on me.
+
+Pol.
+Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
+This is the very ecstasy of love;
+Whose violent property fordoes itself,
+And leads the will to desperate undertakings,
+As oft as any passion under heaven
+That does afflict our natures. I am sorry,--
+What, have you given him any hard words of late?
+
+Oph.
+No, my good lord; but, as you did command,
+I did repel his letters and denied
+His access to me.
+
+Pol.
+That hath made him mad.
+I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
+I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
+And meant to wreck thee; but beshrew my jealousy!
+It seems it as proper to our age
+To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
+As it is common for the younger sort
+To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
+This must be known; which, being kept close, might move
+More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene II. A room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter King, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants.]
+
+King.
+Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
+Moreover that we much did long to see you,
+The need we have to use you did provoke
+Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
+Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it,
+Since nor the exterior nor the inward man
+Resembles that it was. What it should be,
+More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
+So much from the understanding of himself,
+I cannot dream of: I entreat you both
+That, being of so young days brought up with him,
+And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour,
+That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
+Some little time: so by your companies
+To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
+So much as from occasion you may glean,
+Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
+That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
+
+Queen.
+Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
+And sure I am two men there are not living
+To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
+To show us so much gentry and good-will
+As to expend your time with us awhile,
+For the supply and profit of our hope,
+Your visitation shall receive such thanks
+As fits a king's remembrance.
+
+Ros.
+Both your majesties
+Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
+Put your dread pleasures more into command
+Than to entreaty.
+
+Guil.
+We both obey,
+And here give up ourselves, in the full bent,
+To lay our service freely at your feet,
+To be commanded.
 
-   Hor. Infaith my Lord, not I
+King.
+Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
 
-   Mar. Nor I my Lord: in faith
+Queen.
+Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
+And I beseech you instantly to visit
+My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you,
+And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
 
-   Ham. Vpon my sword
+Guil.
+Heavens make our presence and our practices
+Pleasant and helpful to him!
+
+Queen.
+Ay, amen!
+
+[Exeunt Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and some Attendants].
+
+[Enter Polonius.]
+
+Pol.
+Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
+Are joyfully return'd.
+
+King.
+Thou still hast been the father of good news.
+
+Pol.
+Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
+I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
+Both to my God and to my gracious king:
+And I do think,--or else this brain of mine
+Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
+As it hath us'd to do,--that I have found
+The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
+
+King.
+O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
+
+Pol.
+Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
+My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
+
+King.
+Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
+
+[Exit Polonius.]
+
+He tells me, my sweet queen, he hath found
+The head and source of all your son's distemper.
+
+Queen.
+I doubt it is no other but the main,--
+His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.
+
+King.
+Well, we shall sift him.
+
+[Enter Polonius, with Voltimand and Cornelius.]
+
+Welcome, my good friends!
+Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
+
+Volt.
+Most fair return of greetings and desires.
+Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
+His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
+To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
+But, better look'd into, he truly found
+It was against your highness; whereat griev'd,--
+That so his sickness, age, and impotence
+Was falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests
+On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
+Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine,
+Makes vow before his uncle never more
+To give th' assay of arms against your majesty.
+Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
+Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee;
+And his commission to employ those soldiers,
+So levied as before, against the Polack:
+With an entreaty, herein further shown,
+[Gives a paper.]
+That it might please you to give quiet pass
+Through your dominions for this enterprise,
+On such regards of safety and allowance
+As therein are set down.
+
+King.
+It likes us well;
+And at our more consider'd time we'll read,
+Answer, and think upon this business.
+Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
+Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
+Most welcome home!
+
+[Exeunt Voltimand and Cornelius.]
+
+Pol.
+This business is well ended.--
+My liege, and madam,--to expostulate
+What majesty should be, what duty is,
+Why day is day, night is night, and time is time.
+Were nothing but to waste night, day, and time.
+Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
+And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
+I will be brief:--your noble son is mad:
+Mad call I it; for to define true madness,
+What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
+But let that go.
+
+Queen.
+More matter, with less art.
+
+Pol.
+Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
+That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
+And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
+But farewell it, for I will use no art.
+Mad let us grant him then: and now remains
+That we find out the cause of this effect;
+Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
+For this effect defective comes by cause:
+Thus it remains, and the remainder thus.
+Perpend.
+I have a daughter,--have whilst she is mine,--
+Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
+Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
+[Reads.]
+'To the celestial, and my soul's idol, the most beautified
+Ophelia,'--
+That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is a vile
+phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
+[Reads.]
+'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
+
+Queen.
+Came this from Hamlet to her?
+
+Pol.
+Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
+[Reads.]
+  'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
+     Doubt that the sun doth move;
+   Doubt truth to be a liar;
+     But never doubt I love.
+'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I have not art to
+reckon my groans: but that I love thee best, O most best, believe
+it. Adieu.
+  'Thine evermore, most dear lady, whilst this machine is to him,
+     HAMLET.'
+This, in obedience, hath my daughter show'd me;
+And more above, hath his solicitings,
+As they fell out by time, by means, and place,
+All given to mine ear.
+
+King.
+But how hath she
+Receiv'd his love?
+
+Pol.
+What do you think of me?
+
+King.
+As of a man faithful and honourable.
+
+Pol.
+I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
+When I had seen this hot love on the wing,--
+As I perceiv'd it, I must tell you that,
+Before my daughter told me,-- what might you,
+Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
+If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
+Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb;
+Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;--
+What might you think? No, I went round to work,
+And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
+'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy sphere;
+This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
+That she should lock herself from his resort,
+Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
+Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
+And he, repulsed,--a short tale to make,--
+Fell into a sadness; then into a fast;
+Thence to a watch; thence into a weakness;
+Thence to a lightness; and, by this declension,
+Into the madness wherein now he raves,
+And all we wail for.
+
+King.
+Do you think 'tis this?
+
+Queen.
+It may be, very likely.
+
+Pol.
+Hath there been such a time,--I'd fain know that--
+That I have positively said ''Tis so,'
+When it prov'd otherwise?
+
+King.
+Not that I know.
+
+Pol.
+Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
+[Points to his head and shoulder.]
+If circumstances lead me, I will find
+Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
+Within the centre.
+
+King.
+How may we try it further?
+
+Pol.
+You know sometimes he walks for hours together
+Here in the lobby.
+
+Queen.
+So he does indeed.
+
+Pol.
+At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
+Be you and I behind an arras then;
+Mark the encounter: if he love her not,
+And he not from his reason fall'n thereon
+Let me be no assistant for a state,
+But keep a farm and carters.
+
+King.
+We will try it.
+
+Queen.
+But look where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
+
+Pol.
+Away, I do beseech you, both away
+I'll board him presently:--O, give me leave.
+
+[Exeunt King, Queen, and Attendants.]
+
+[Enter Hamlet, reading.]
+
+How does my good Lord Hamlet?
+
+Ham.
+Well, God-a-mercy.
+
+Pol.
+Do you know me, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Excellent well; you're a fishmonger.
+
+Pol.
+Not I, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Then I would you were so honest a man.
+
+Pol.
+Honest, my lord!
+
+Ham.
+Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
+picked out of ten thousand.
+
+Pol.
+That's very true, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a god-kissing
+carrion,--Have you a daughter?
+
+Pol.
+I have, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a blessing, but not
+as your daughter may conceive:--friend, look to't.
+
+Pol.
+How say you by that?--[Aside.] Still harping on my daughter:--yet
+he knew me not at first; he said I was a fishmonger: he is far
+gone, far gone: and truly in my youth I suffered much extremity
+for love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.--What do you
+read, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Words, words, words.
+
+Pol.
+What is the matter, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Between who?
+
+Pol.
+I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Slanders, sir: for the satirical slave says here that old men
+have grey beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes
+purging thick amber and plum-tree gum; and that they have a
+plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak hams: all which,
+sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it
+not honesty to have it thus set down; for you yourself, sir,
+should be old as I am, if, like a crab, you could go backward.
+
+Pol.
+[Aside.] Though this be madness, yet there is a method in't.--
+Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Into my grave?
+
+Pol.
+Indeed, that is out o' the air. [Aside.] How pregnant sometimes
+his replies are! a happiness that often madness hits on, which
+reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. I
+will leave him and suddenly contrive the means of meeting between
+him and my daughter.--My honourable lord, I will most humbly take
+my leave of you.
+
+Ham.
+You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
+willingly part withal,--except my life, except my life, except my
+life.
+
+Pol.
+Fare you well, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+These tedious old fools!
+
+[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+Pol.
+You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
+
+Ros.
+[To Polonius.] God save you, sir!
+
+[Exit Polonius.]
+
+Guil.
+My honoured lord!
+
+Ros.
+My most dear lord!
+
+Ham.
+My excellent good friends! How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,
+Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
+
+Ros.
+As the indifferent children of the earth.
+
+Guil.
+Happy in that we are not over-happy;
+On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
+
+Ham.
+Nor the soles of her shoe?
+
+Ros.
+Neither, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of her
+favours?
+
+Guil.
+Faith, her privates we.
+
+Ham.
+In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she is a
+strumpet. What's the news?
+
+Ros.
+None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
+
+Ham.
+Then is doomsday near; but your news is not true. Let me
+question more in particular: what have you, my good friends,
+deserved at the hands of fortune, that she sends you to prison
+hither?
+
+Guil.
+Prison, my lord!
+
+Ham.
+Denmark's a prison.
+
+Ros.
+Then is the world one.
+
+Ham.
+A goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and
+dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
+
+Ros.
+We think not so, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Why, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good
+or bad but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison.
+
+Ros.
+Why, then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your
+mind.
+
+Ham.
+O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a
+king of infinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.
+
+Guil.
+Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of
+the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
+
+Ham.
+A dream itself is but a shadow.
+
+Ros.
+Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that
+it is but a shadow's shadow.
+
+Ham.
+Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd
+heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we to the court? for, by my
+fay, I cannot reason.
+
+Ros. and Guild.
+We'll wait upon you.
+
+Ham.
+No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest of my
+servants; for, to speak to you like an honest man, I am most
+dreadfully attended. But, in the beaten way of friendship, what
+make you at Elsinore?
+
+Ros.
+To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
+
+Ham.
+Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you:
+and sure, dear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were
+you not sent for? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free
+visitation? Come, deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
+
+Guil.
+What should we say, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Why, anything--but to the purpose. You were sent for; and
+there is a kind of confession in your looks, which your modesties
+have not craft enough to colour: I know the good king and queen
+have sent for you.
+
+Ros.
+To what end, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights
+of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the
+obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by what more dear a
+better proposer could charge you withal, be even and direct with
+me, whether you were sent for or no.
+
+Ros.
+[To Guildenstern.] What say you?
+
+Ham.
+[Aside.] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you love me, hold
+not off.
+
+Guil.
+My lord, we were sent for.
+
+Ham.
+I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your
+discovery, and your secrecy to the king and queen moult no
+feather. I have of late,--but wherefore I know not,--lost all my
+mirth, forgone all custom of exercises; and indeed, it goes so
+heavily with my disposition that this goodly frame, the earth,
+seems to me a sterile promontory; this most excellent canopy, the
+air, look you, this brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical
+roof fretted with golden fire,--why, it appears no other thing
+to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a
+piece of work is man! How noble in reason! how infinite in
+faculties! in form and moving, how express and admirable! in
+action how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a god! the
+beauty of the world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, what
+is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman
+neither, though by your smiling you seem to say so.
+
+Ros.
+My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
+
+Ham.
+Why did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?
+
+Ros.
+To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what lenten
+entertainment the players shall receive from you: we coted them
+on the way; and hither are they coming to offer you service.
+
+Ham.
+He that plays the king shall be welcome,--his majesty shall
+have tribute of me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and
+target; the lover shall not sigh gratis; the humorous man shall
+end his part in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
+lungs are tickle o' the sere; and the lady shall say her mind
+freely, or the blank verse shall halt for't. What players are
+they?
+
+Ros.
+Even those you were wont to take such delight in,--the
+tragedians of the city.
+
+Ham.
+How chances it they travel? their residence, both in
+reputation and profit, was better both ways.
+
+Ros.
+I think their inhibition comes by the means of the late
+innovation.
+
+Ham.
+Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the
+city? Are they so followed?
+
+Ros.
+No, indeed, are they not.
+
+Ham.
+How comes it? do they grow rusty?
+
+Ros.
+Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but there is,
+sir, an aery of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top
+of question, and are most tyrannically clapped for't: these are
+now the fashion; and so berattle the common stages,--so they call
+them,--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of goose-quills and
+dare scarce come thither.
+
+Ham.
+What, are they children? who maintains 'em? How are they
+escoted? Will they pursue the quality no longer than they can
+sing? will they not say afterwards, if they should grow
+themselves to common players,--as it is most like, if their means
+are no better,--their writers do them wrong to make them exclaim
+against their own succession?
+
+Ros.
+Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation
+holds it no sin to tarre them to controversy: there was, for
+awhile, no money bid for argument unless the poet and the player
+went to cuffs in the question.
+
+Ham.
+Is't possible?
+
+Guil.
+O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
+
+Ham.
+Do the boys carry it away?
+
+Ros.
+Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
+
+Ham.
+It is not very strange; for my uncle is king of Denmark, and
+those that would make mouths at him while my father lived, give
+twenty, forty, fifty, a hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in
+little. 'Sblood, there is something in this more than natural, if
+philosophy could find it out.
+
+[Flourish of trumpets within.]
+
+Guil.
+There are the players.
+
+Ham.
+Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come: the
+appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony: let me comply
+with you in this garb; lest my extent to the players, which I
+tell you must show fairly outward, should more appear like
+entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my uncle-father
+and aunt-mother are deceived.
+
+Guil.
+In what, my dear lord?
+
+Ham.
+I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is southerly I
+know a hawk from a handsaw.
+
+[Enter Polonius.]
+
+Pol.
+Well be with you, gentlemen!
+
+Ham.
+Hark you, Guildenstern;--and you too;--at each ear a hearer: that
+great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.
+
+Ros.
+Happily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old
+man is twice a child.
+
+Ham.
+I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players; mark it.--You
+say right, sir: o' Monday morning; 'twas so indeed.
+
+Pol.
+My lord, I have news to tell you.
+
+Ham.
+My lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in
+Rome,--
+
+Pol.
+The actors are come hither, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Buzz, buzz!
+
+Pol.
+Upon my honour,--
+
+Ham.
+Then came each actor on his ass,--
+
+Pol.
+The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy,
+history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral,
+tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene
+individable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy nor
+Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are
+the only men.
+
+Ham.
+O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
+
+Pol.
+What treasure had he, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Why--
+   'One fair daughter, and no more,
+   The which he loved passing well.'
+
+
+Pol.
+[Aside.] Still on my daughter.
+
+Ham.
+Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
+
+Pol.
+If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I
+love passing well.
+
+Ham.
+Nay, that follows not.
+
+Pol.
+What follows, then, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Why--
+   'As by lot, God wot,'
+and then, you know,
+   'It came to pass, as most like it was--'
+The first row of the pious chanson will show you more; for look
+where my abridgment comes.
+
+[Enter four or five Players.]
+
+You are welcome, masters; welcome, all:--I am glad to see thee
+well.--welcome, good friends.--O, my old friend! Thy face is
+valanc'd since I saw thee last; comest thou to beard me in
+Denmark?--What, my young lady and mistress! By'r lady, your
+ladyship is nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
+altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like a piece of
+uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the ring.--Masters, you are
+all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at
+anything we see: we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a
+taste of your quality: come, a passionate speech.
+
+I Play.
+What speech, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+I heard thee speak me a speech once,--but it was never acted;
+or if it was, not above once; for the play, I remember, pleased
+not the million, 'twas caviare to the general; but it was,--as I
+received it, and others, whose judgments in such matters cried in
+the top of mine,--an excellent play, well digested in the scenes,
+set down with as much modesty as cunning. I remember, one said
+there were no sallets in the lines to make the matter savoury,
+nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the author of
+affectation; but called it an honest method, as wholesome as
+sweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it
+I chiefly loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it
+especially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter: if it live in
+your memory, begin at this line;--let me see, let me see:--
+
+The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,--
+
+it is not so:-- it begins with Pyrrhus:--
+
+  'The rugged Pyrrhus,--he whose sable arms,
+   Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
+   When he lay couched in the ominous horse,--
+   Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
+   With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
+   Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
+   With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
+   Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
+   That lend a tyrannous and a damned light
+   To their vile murders: roasted in wrath and fire,
+   And thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,
+   With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
+   Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
+
+So, proceed you.
+
+Pol.
+'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good
+discretion.
+
+I Play.
+   Anon he finds him,
+   Striking too short at Greeks: his antique sword,
+   Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
+   Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
+   Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
+   But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
+   The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
+   Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
+   Stoops to his base; and with a hideous crash
+   Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for lo! his sword,
+   Which was declining on the milky head
+   Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
+   So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood;
+   And, like a neutral to his will and matter,
+   Did nothing.
+   But as we often see, against some storm,
+   A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
+   The bold winds speechless, and the orb below
+   As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
+   Doth rend the region; so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
+   A roused vengeance sets him new a-work;
+   And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
+   On Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,
+   With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
+   Now falls on Priam.--
+   Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
+   In general synod, take away her power;
+   Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
+   And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
+   As low as to the fiends!
+
+Pol.
+This is too long.
+
+Ham.
+It shall to the barber's, with your beard.--Pr'ythee say on.--
+He's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps:--say on; come
+to Hecuba.
+
+I Play.
+   But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,--
+
+Ham.
+'The mobled queen'?
+
+Pol.
+That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.
+
+I Play.
+   Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
+   With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
+   Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
+   About her lank and all o'erteemed loins,
+   A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;--
+   Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
+   'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd:
+   But if the gods themselves did see her then,
+   When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
+   In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
+   The instant burst of clamour that she made,--
+   Unless things mortal move them not at all,--
+   Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
+   And passion in the gods.
+
+Pol.
+Look, whether he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's
+eyes.--Pray you, no more!
+
+Ham.
+'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.--
+Good my lord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you
+hear? Let them be well used; for they are the abstracts and brief
+chronicles of the time; after your death you were better have a
+bad epitaph than their ill report while you live.
+
+Pol.
+My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
+
+Ham.
+Odd's bodikin, man, better: use every man after his
+desert, and who should scape whipping? Use them after your own
+honour and dignity: the less they deserve, the more merit is in
+your bounty. Take them in.
+
+Pol.
+Come, sirs.
+
+Ham.
+Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
+
+[Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First.]
+
+Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play 'The Murder of
+Gonzago'?
+
+I Play.
+Ay, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need, study a
+speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and
+insert in't? could you not?
+
+I Play.
+Ay, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Very well.--Follow that lord; and look you mock him not.
+
+[Exit First Player.]
+
+--My good friends [to Ros. and Guild.], I'll leave you till
+night: you are welcome to Elsinore.
+
+Ros.
+Good my lord!
+
+[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+Ham.
+Ay, so, God b' wi' ye!
+Now I am alone.
+O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
+Is it not monstrous that this player here,
+But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
+Could force his soul so to his own conceit
+That from her working all his visage wan'd;
+Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
+A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
+With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
+For Hecuba?
+What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
+That he should weep for her? What would he do,
+Had he the motive and the cue for passion
+That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
+And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
+Make mad the guilty, and appal the free;
+Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
+The very faculties of eyes and ears.
+Yet I,
+A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
+Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
+And can say nothing; no, not for a king
+Upon whose property and most dear life
+A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
+Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
+Plucks off my beard and blows it in my face?
+Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat
+As deep as to the lungs? who does me this, ha?
+'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
+But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
+To make oppression bitter; or ere this
+I should have fatted all the region kites
+With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
+Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
+O, vengeance!
+Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
+That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
+Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
+Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words
+And fall a-cursing like a very drab,
+A scullion!
+Fie upon't! foh!--About, my brain! I have heard
+That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
+Have by the very cunning of the scene
+Been struck so to the soul that presently
+They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
+For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
+With most miraculous organ, I'll have these players
+Play something like the murder of my father
+Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
+I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
+I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
+May be the devil: and the devil hath power
+To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
+Out of my weakness and my melancholy,--
+As he is very potent with such spirits,--
+Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
+More relative than this.--the play's the thing
+Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+
+
+
+ACT III.
+
+Scene I. A room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosencrantz, and
+Guildenstern.]
+
+King.
+And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
+Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
+Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
+With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
+
+Ros.
+He does confess he feels himself distracted,
+But from what cause he will by no means speak.
+
+Guil.
+Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
+But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof
+When we would bring him on to some confession
+Of his true state.
+
+Queen.
+Did he receive you well?
+
+Ros.
+Most like a gentleman.
+
+Guil.
+But with much forcing of his disposition.
+
+Ros.
+Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
+Most free in his reply.
+
+Queen.
+Did you assay him
+To any pastime?
+
+Ros.
+Madam, it so fell out that certain players
+We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him,
+And there did seem in him a kind of joy
+To hear of it: they are about the court,
+And, as I think, they have already order
+This night to play before him.
+
+Pol.
+'Tis most true;
+And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
+To hear and see the matter.
+
+King.
+With all my heart; and it doth much content me
+To hear him so inclin'd.--
+Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
+And drive his purpose on to these delights.
+
+Ros.
+We shall, my lord.
+
+[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+King.
+Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
+For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
+That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
+Affront Ophelia:
+Her father and myself,--lawful espials,--
+Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
+We may of their encounter frankly judge;
+And gather by him, as he is behav'd,
+If't be the affliction of his love or no
+That thus he suffers for.
+
+Queen.
+I shall obey you:--
+And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
+That your good beauties be the happy cause
+Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
+Will bring him to his wonted way again,
+To both your honours.
+
+Oph.
+Madam, I wish it may.
+
+[Exit Queen.]
+
+Pol.
+Ophelia, walk you here.--Gracious, so please you,
+We will bestow ourselves.--[To Ophelia.] Read on this book;
+That show of such an exercise may colour
+Your loneliness.--We are oft to blame in this,--
+'Tis too much prov'd,--that with devotion's visage
+And pious action we do sugar o'er
+The Devil himself.
+
+King.
+[Aside.] O, 'tis too true!
+How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
+The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
+Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
+Than is my deed to my most painted word:
+O heavy burden!
+
+Pol.
+I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
+
+[Exeunt King and Polonius.]
+
+[Enter Hamlet.]
+
+Ham.
+To be, or not to be,--that is the question:--
+Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
+The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
+Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
+And by opposing end them?--To die,--to sleep,--
+No more; and by a sleep to say we end
+The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
+That flesh is heir to,--'tis a consummation
+Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,--to sleep;--
+To sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there's the rub;
+For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
+When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
+Must give us pause: there's the respect
+That makes calamity of so long life;
+For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
+The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
+The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
+The insolence of office, and the spurns
+That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
+When he himself might his quietus make
+With a bare bodkin? who would these fardels bear,
+To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
+But that the dread of something after death,--
+The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
+No traveller returns,--puzzles the will,
+And makes us rather bear those ills we have
+Than fly to others that we know not of?
+Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
+And thus the native hue of resolution
+Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
+And enterprises of great pith and moment,
+With this regard, their currents turn awry,
+And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
+The fair Ophelia!--Nymph, in thy orisons
+Be all my sins remember'd.
+
+Oph.
+Good my lord,
+How does your honour for this many a day?
+
+Ham.
+I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
+
+Oph.
+My lord, I have remembrances of yours
+That I have longed long to re-deliver.
+I pray you, now receive them.
+
+Ham.
+No, not I;
+I never gave you aught.
+
+Oph.
+My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
+And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd
+As made the things more rich; their perfume lost,
+Take these again; for to the noble mind
+Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
+There, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Ha, ha! are you honest?
+
+Oph.
+My lord?
+
+Ham.
+Are you fair?
+
+Oph.
+What means your lordship?
+
+Ham.
+That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no
+discourse to your beauty.
+
+Oph.
+Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?
+
+Ham.
+Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform
+honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can
+translate beauty into his likeness: this was sometime a paradox,
+but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.
+
+Oph.
+Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
+
+Ham.
+You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so
+inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it: I loved you
+not.
+
+Oph.
+I was the more deceived.
+
+Ham.
+Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a breeder of
+sinners? I am myself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse
+me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me:
+I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my
+beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give
+them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I
+do crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves, all;
+believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your
+father?
+
+Oph.
+At home, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool
+nowhere but in's own house. Farewell.
+
+Oph.
+O, help him, you sweet heavens!
+
+Ham.
+If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry,--
+be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape
+calumny. Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt
+needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what
+monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too.
+Farewell.
+
+Oph.
+O heavenly powers, restore him!
+
+Ham.
+I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God hath
+given you one face, and you make yourselves another: you jig, you
+amble, and you lisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your
+wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made
+me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages: those that are
+married already, all but one, shall live; the rest shall keep as
+they are. To a nunnery, go.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Oph.
+O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
+The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword,
+The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
+The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
+The observ'd of all observers,--quite, quite down!
+And I, of ladies most deject and wretched
+That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
+Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
+Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
+That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
+Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
+To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
+
+[Re-enter King and Polonius.]
+
+King.
+Love! his affections do not that way tend;
+Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
+Was not like madness. There's something in his soul
+O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
+And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
+Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
+I have in quick determination
+Thus set it down:--he shall with speed to England
+For the demand of our neglected tribute:
+Haply the seas, and countries different,
+With variable objects, shall expel
+This something-settled matter in his heart;
+Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
+From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
+
+Pol.
+It shall do well: but yet do I believe
+The origin and commencement of his grief
+Sprung from neglected love.--How now, Ophelia!
+You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
+We heard it all.--My lord, do as you please;
+But if you hold it fit, after the play,
+Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
+To show his grief: let her be round with him;
+And I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear
+Of all their conference. If she find him not,
+To England send him; or confine him where
+Your wisdom best shall think.
+
+King.
+It shall be so:
+Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
+
+[Enter Hamlet and certain Players.]
+
+Ham.
+Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
+trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your
+players do, I had as lief the town crier spoke my lines. Nor do
+not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all
+gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
+whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a
+temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the
+soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to
+tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who,
+for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb
+shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
+Termagant; it out-herods Herod: pray you avoid it.
+
+I Player.
+I warrant your honour.
+
+Ham.
+Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
+tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
+this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of
+nature: for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
+whose end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold, as
+'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own image,
+scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his
+form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though
+it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious
+grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance,
+o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I
+have seen play,--and heard others praise, and that highly,--not
+to speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent of
+Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
+strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's
+journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated
+humanity so abominably.
+
+I Player.
+I hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.
+
+Ham.
+O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns
+speak no more than is set down for them: for there be of them
+that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren
+spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary
+question of the play be then to be considered: that's villanous
+and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go
+make you ready.
+
+[Exeunt Players.]
+
+[Enter Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
+
+How now, my lord! will the king hear this piece of work?
+
+Pol.
+And the queen too, and that presently.
+
+Ham.
+Bid the players make haste.
+
+[Exit Polonius.]
+
+Will you two help to hasten them?
+
+Ros. and Guil.
+We will, my lord.
+
+[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
+
+Ham.
+What, ho, Horatio!
+
+[Enter Horatio.]
+
+Hor.
+Here, sweet lord, at your service.
+
+Ham.
+Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
+As e'er my conversation cop'd withal.
+
+Hor.
+O, my dear lord,--
+
+Ham.
+Nay, do not think I flatter;
+For what advancement may I hope from thee,
+That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
+To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
+No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp;
+And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
+Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
+Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
+And could of men distinguish, her election
+Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
+As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
+A man that Fortune's buffets and rewards
+Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and bles'd are those
+Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled
+That they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger
+To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
+That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
+In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
+As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
+There is a play to-night before the king;
+One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
+Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
+I pr'ythee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,
+Even with the very comment of thy soul
+Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
+Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
+It is a damned ghost that we have seen;
+And my imaginations are as foul
+As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
+For I mine eyes will rivet to his face;
+And, after, we will both our judgments join
+In censure of his seeming.
+
+Hor.
+Well, my lord:
+If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
+And scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
+
+Ham.
+They are coming to the play. I must be idle:
+Get you a place.
+
+[Danish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,
+Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and others.]
+
+King.
+How fares our cousin Hamlet?
+
+Ham.
+Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,
+promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
+
+King.
+I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not
+mine.
+
+Ham.
+No, nor mine now. My lord, you play'd once i' the university, you
+say? [To Polonius.]
+
+Pol.
+That did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.
+
+Ham.
+What did you enact?
+
+Pol.
+I did enact Julius Caesar; I was kill'd i' the Capitol; Brutus
+killed me.
+
+Ham.
+It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.--Be
+the players ready?
+
+Ros.
+Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
+
+Queen.
+Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
+
+Ham.
+No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
+
+Pol.
+O, ho! do you mark that? [To the King.]
+
+Ham.
+Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
+[Lying down at Ophelia's feet.]
+
+Oph.
+No, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+I mean, my head upon your lap?
+
+Oph.
+Ay, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Do you think I meant country matters?
+
+Oph.
+I think nothing, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
+
+Oph.
+What is, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Nothing.
+
+Oph.
+You are merry, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Who, I?
+
+Oph.
+Ay, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+O, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry?
+for look you how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died
+within 's two hours.
+
+Oph.
+Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a
+suit of sables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten
+yet? Then there's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life
+half a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches then; or else
+shall he suffer not thinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose
+epitaph is 'For, O, for, O, the hobby-horse is forgot!'
+
+[Trumpets sound. The dumb show enters.]
+
+[Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing
+him and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation
+unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her
+neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing
+him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
+crown, kisses it, pours poison in the king's ears, and exit. The
+Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate action.
+The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,
+seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The
+Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts; she seems loth and unwilling
+awhile, but in the end accepts his love.]
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+Oph.
+What means this, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
+
+Oph.
+Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
+
+[Enter Prologue.]
+
+Ham.
+We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel;
+they'll tell all.
+
+Oph.
+Will he tell us what this show meant?
+
+Ham.
+Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you ashamed to
+show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
+
+Oph.
+You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
+
+Pro.
+   For us, and for our tragedy,
+   Here stooping to your clemency,
+   We beg your hearing patiently.
+
+Ham.
+Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
+
+Oph.
+'Tis brief, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+As woman's love.
+
+[Enter a King and a Queen.]
+
+P. King.
+Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
+Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
+And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
+About the world have times twelve thirties been,
+Since love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands,
+Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
+
+P. Queen.
+So many journeys may the sun and moon
+Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
+But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
+So far from cheer and from your former state.
+That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
+Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
+For women's fear and love holds quantity;
+In neither aught, or in extremity.
+Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
+And as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:
+Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
+Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
+
+P. King.
+Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
+My operant powers their functions leave to do:
+And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
+Honour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind
+For husband shalt thou,--
+
+P. Queen.
+O, confound the rest!
+Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
+In second husband let me be accurst!
+None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
+
+Ham.
+[Aside.] Wormwood, wormwood!
+
+P. Queen.
+The instances that second marriage move
+Are base respects of thrift, but none of love.
+A second time I kill my husband dead
+When second husband kisses me in bed.
+
+P. King.
+I do believe you think what now you speak;
+But what we do determine oft we break.
+Purpose is but the slave to memory;
+Of violent birth, but poor validity:
+Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
+But fall unshaken when they mellow be.
+Most necessary 'tis that we forget
+To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
+What to ourselves in passion we propose,
+The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
+The violence of either grief or joy
+Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
+Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
+Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
+This world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange
+That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
+For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
+Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
+The great man down, you mark his favourite flies,
+The poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;
+And hitherto doth love on fortune tend:
+For who not needs shall never lack a friend;
+And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
+Directly seasons him his enemy.
+But, orderly to end where I begun,--
+Our wills and fates do so contrary run
+That our devices still are overthrown;
+Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
+So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
+But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
 
-   Marcell. We haue sworne my Lord already
+P. Queen.
+Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
+Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
+To desperation turn my trust and hope!
+An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
+Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
+Meet what I would have well, and it destroy!
+Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
+If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
 
-   Ham. Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed
+Ham.
+If she should break it now! [To Ophelia.]
 
-   Gho. Sweare.
+P. King.
+'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
+My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
+The tedious day with sleep.
+[Sleeps.]
 
-Ghost cries vnder the Stage.
+P. Queen.
+Sleep rock thy brain,
+And never come mischance between us twain!
 
-  Ham. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny?
-Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge
-Consent to sweare
+[Exit.]
 
-   Hor. Propose the Oath my Lord
+Ham.
+Madam, how like you this play?
 
-   Ham. Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene.
-Sweare by my sword
+Queen.
+The lady protests too much, methinks.
 
-   Gho. Sweare
+Ham.
+O, but she'll keep her word.
 
-   Ham. Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd,
-Come hither Gentlemen,
-And lay your hands againe vpon my sword,
-Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard:
-Sweare by my Sword
+King.
+Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?
 
-   Gho. Sweare
+Ham.
+No, no! They do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' the
+world.
 
-   Ham. Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast?
-A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends
+King.
+What do you call the play?
 
-   Hor. Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange
+Ham.
+The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the
+image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the duke's name;
+his wife, Baptista: you shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of
+work: but what o' that? your majesty, and we that have free
+souls, it touches us not: let the gall'd jade wince; our withers
+are unwrung.
 
-   Ham. And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome.
-There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio,
-Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come,
-Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy,
-How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe;
-(As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet
-To put an Anticke disposition on:)
-That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall
-With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake;
-Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase;
-As well, we know, or we could and if we would,
-Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might,
-Or such ambiguous giuing out to note,
-That you know ought of me; this not to doe:
-So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you:
-Sweare
+[Enter Lucianus.]
 
-   Ghost. Sweare
+This is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.
 
-   Ham. Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen,
-With all my loue I doe commend me to you;
-And what so poore a man as Hamlet is,
-May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you,
-God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together,
-And still your fingers on your lippes I pray,
-The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight,
-That euer I was borne to set it right.
-Nay, come let's goe together.
+Oph.
+You are a good chorus, my lord.
 
-Exeunt.
+Ham.
+I could interpret between you and your love, if I could see
+the puppets dallying.
 
+Oph.
+You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
 
-Actus Secundus.
+Ham.
+It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
 
-Enter Polonius, and Reynoldo.
+Oph.
+Still better, and worse.
 
-  Polon. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo
+Ham.
+So you must take your husbands.--Begin, murderer; pox, leave
+thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:--'The croaking raven doth
+bellow for revenge.'
 
-   Reynol. I will my Lord
+Luc.
+Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
+Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
+Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
+With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
+Thy natural magic and dire property
+On wholesome life usurp immediately.
 
-   Polon. You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo,
-Before you visite him you make inquiry
-Of his behauiour
+[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears.]
 
-   Reynol. My Lord, I did intend it
+Ham.
+He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago:
+The story is extant, and written in very choice Italian; you
+shall see anon how the murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
 
-   Polon. Marry, well said;
-Very well said. Looke you Sir,
-Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
-And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe:
-What company, at what expence: and finding
-By this encompassement and drift of question,
-That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer
-Then your particular demands will touch it,
-Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him,
-And thus I know his father and his friends,
-And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo?
-  Reynol. I, very well my Lord
-
-   Polon. And in part him, but you may say not well;
-But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde;
-Addicted so and so; and there put on him
-What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke,
-As may dishonour him; take heed of that:
-But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips,
-As are Companions noted and most knowne
-To youth and liberty
-
-   Reynol. As gaming my Lord
-
-   Polon. I, or drinking, fencing, swearing,
-Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre
-
-   Reynol. My Lord that would dishonour him
-
-   Polon. Faith no, as you may season it in the charge;
-You must not put another scandall on him,
-That hee is open to Incontinencie;
-That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly,
-That they may seeme the taints of liberty;
-The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde,
-A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault
-
-   Reynol. But my good Lord
-
-   Polon. Wherefore should you doe this?
-  Reynol. I my Lord, I would know that
-
-   Polon. Marry Sir, heere's my drift,
-And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant:
-You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne,
-As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working:
-Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound,
-Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes,
-The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd
-He closes with you in this consequence:
-Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman.
-According to the Phrase and the Addition,
-Of man and Country
-
-   Reynol. Very good my Lord
-
-   Polon. And then Sir does he this?
-He does: what was I about to say?
-I was about say somthing: where did I leaue?
-  Reynol. At closes in the consequence:
-At friend, or so, and Gentleman
-
-   Polon. At closes in the consequence, I marry,
-He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman,
-I saw him yesterday, or tother day;
-Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say,
-There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse,
-There falling out at Tennis; or perchance,
-I saw him enter such a house of saile;
-Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now;
-Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth;
-And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
-With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias,
-By indirections finde directions out:
-So by my former Lecture and aduice
-Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not?
-  Reynol. My Lord I haue
-
-   Polon. God buy you; fare you well
-
-   Reynol. Good my Lord
-
-   Polon. Obserue his inclination in your selfe
-
-   Reynol. I shall my Lord
-
-   Polon. And let him plye his Musicke
-
-   Reynol. Well, my Lord.
-Enter.
-
-Enter Ophelia.
-
-  Polon. Farewell:
-How now Ophelia, what's the matter?
-  Ophe. Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted
-
-   Polon. With what, in the name of Heauen?
-  Ophe. My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber,
-Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd,
-No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd,
-Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle,
-Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other,
-And with a looke so pitious in purport,
-As if he had been loosed out of hell,
-To speake of horrors: he comes before me
-
-   Polon. Mad for thy Loue?
-  Ophe. My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it
-
-   Polon. What said he?
-  Ophe. He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard;
-Then goes he to the length of all his arme;
-And with his other hand thus o're his brow,
-He fals to such perusall of my face,
-As he would draw it. Long staid he so,
-At last, a little shaking of mine Arme:
-And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe;
-He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound,
-That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke,
-And end his being. That done, he lets me goe,
-And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd,
-He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes,
-For out adores he went without their helpe;
-And to the last, bended their light on me
-
-   Polon. Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King,
-This is the very extasie of Loue,
-Whose violent property foredoes it selfe,
-And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings,
-As oft as any passion vnder Heauen,
-That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie,
-What haue you giuen him any hard words of late?
-  Ophe. No my good Lord: but as you did command,
-I did repell his Letters, and deny'de
-His accesse to me
-
-   Pol. That hath made him mad.
-I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
-I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle,
-And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:
-It seemes it is as proper to our Age,
-To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions,
-As it is common for the yonger sort
-To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King,
-This must be knowne, being kept close might moue
-More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-
-Scena Secunda.
-
-Enter King, Queene, Rosincrane, and Guildensterne Cum alijs.
-
-  King. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
-Moreouer, that we much did long to see you,
-The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke
-Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard
-Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it,
-Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man
-Resembles that it was. What it should bee
-More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him
-So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe,
-I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both,
-That being of so young dayes brought vp with him:
-And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour,
-That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court
-Some little time: so by your Companies
-To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather
-So much as from Occasions you may gleane,
-That open'd lies within our remedie
+Oph.
+The King rises.
 
-   Qu. Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
-And sure I am, two men there are not liuing,
-To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
-To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will,
-As to expend your time with vs a-while,
-For the supply and profit of our Hope,
-Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes
-As fits a Kings remembrance
-
-   Rosin. Both your Maiesties
-Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs,
-Put your dread pleasures, more into Command
-Then to Entreatie
-
-   Guil. We both obey,
-And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent,
-To lay our Seruices freely at your feete,
-To be commanded
+Ham.
+What, frighted with false fire!
 
-   King. Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne
+Queen.
+How fares my lord?
 
-   Qu. Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance.
-And I beseech you instantly to visit
-My too much changed Sonne.
-Go some of ye,
-And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is
-
-   Guil. Heauens make our presence and our practises
-Pleasant and helpfull to him.
-Enter.
-
-  Queene. Amen.
-Enter Polonius.
-
-  Pol. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord,
-Are ioyfully return'd
-
-   King. Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes
-
-   Pol. Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege,
-I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule,
-Both to my God, one to my gracious King:
-And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine
-Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure
-As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found
-The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie
-
-   King. Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare
-
-   Pol. Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors,
-My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast
-
-   King. Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in.
-He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found
-The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper
-
-   Qu. I doubt it is no other, but the maine,
-His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage.
-Enter Polonius, Voltumand, and Cornelius.
-
-  King. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends:
-Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey?
-  Volt. Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires.
-Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
-His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd
-To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak:
-But better look'd into, he truly found
-It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued,
-That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence
-Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests
-On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
-Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine,
-Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more
-To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie.
-Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy,
-Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee,
-And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers
-So leuied as before, against the Poleak:
-With an intreaty heerein further shewne,
-That it might please you to giue quiet passe
-Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize,
-On such regards of safety and allowance,
-As therein are set downe
-
-   King. It likes vs well:
-And at our more consider'd time wee'l read,
-Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse.
-Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour.
-Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together.
-Most welcome home.
-
-Exit Ambass.
-
-  Pol. This businesse is very well ended.
-My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate
-What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is,
-Why day is day; night, night; and time is time,
-Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time.
-Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit,
-And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes,
-I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad:
-Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse,
-What is't, but to be nothing else but mad.
-But let that go
-
-   Qu. More matter, with lesse Art
-
-   Pol. Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all:
-That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie,
-And pittie it is true: A foolish figure,
-But farewell it: for I will vse no Art.
-Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines
-That we finde out the cause of this effect,
-Or rather say, the cause of this defect;
-For this effect defectiue, comes by cause,
-Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend,
-I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine,
-Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke,
-Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise.
-
-The Letter.
-
-To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia.
-That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde
-Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white
-bosome, these
-
-   Qu. Came this from Hamlet to her
-
-   Pol. Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull.
-Doubt thou, the Starres are fire,
-Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue:
-Doubt Truth to be a Lier,
-But neuer Doubt, I loue.
-O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to
-reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue
-it. Adieu.
-Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this
-Machine is to him, Hamlet.
-This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me:
-And more aboue hath his soliciting,
-As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place,
-All giuen to mine eare
-
-   King. But how hath she receiu'd his Loue?
-  Pol. What do you thinke of me?
-  King. As of a man, faithfull and Honourable
-
-   Pol. I wold faine proue so. But what might you think?
-When I had seene this hot loue on the wing,
-As I perceiued it, I must tell you that
-Before my Daughter told me what might you
-Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think,
-If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke,
-Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe,
-Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight,
-What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke,
-And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake
-Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre,
-This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her,
-That she should locke her selfe from his Resort,
-Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens:
-Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice,
-And he repulsed. A short Tale to make,
-Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast,
-Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse,
-Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension
-Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues,
-And all we waile for
-
-   King. Do you thinke 'tis this?
-  Qu. It may be very likely
-
-   Pol. Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that,
-That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so,
-When it prou'd otherwise?
-  King. Not that I know
-
-   Pol. Take this from this; if this be otherwise,
-If Circumstances leade me, I will finde
-Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede
-Within the Center
-
-   King. How may we try it further?
-  Pol. You know sometimes
-He walkes foure houres together, heere
-In the Lobby
-
-   Qu. So he ha's indeed
-
-   Pol. At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him,
-Be you and I behinde an Arras then,
-Marke the encounter: If he loue her not,
-And be not from his reason falne thereon;
-Let me be no Assistant for a State,
-And keepe a Farme and Carters
-
-   King. We will try it.
-Enter Hamlet reading on a Booke.
-
-  Qu. But looke where sadly the poore wretch
-Comes reading
-
-   Pol. Away I do beseech you, both away,
-Ile boord him presently.
-
-Exit King & Queen.
-
-Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet?
-  Ham. Well, God-a-mercy
-
-   Pol. Do you know me, my Lord?
-  Ham. Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger
-
-   Pol. Not I my Lord
-
-   Ham. Then I would you were so honest a man
-
-   Pol. Honest, my Lord?
-  Ham. I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee
-one man pick'd out of two thousand
-
-   Pol. That's very true, my Lord
-
-   Ham. For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge,
-being a good kissing Carrion-
-Haue you a daughter?
-  Pol. I haue my Lord
-
-   Ham. Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a
-blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend
-looke too't
-
-   Pol. How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter:
-yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger:
-he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth,
-I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile
-speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord?
-  Ham. Words, words, words
-
-   Pol. What is the matter, my Lord?
-  Ham. Betweene who?
-  Pol. I meane the matter you meane, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here,
-that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled;
-their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree
-Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit,
-together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I
-most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it
-not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your
-selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could
-go backward
-
-   Pol. Though this be madnesse,
-Yet there is Method in't: will you walke
-Out of the ayre my Lord?
-  Ham. Into my Graue?
-  Pol. Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre:
-How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are?
-A happinesse,
-That often Madnesse hits on,
-Which Reason and Sanitie could not
-So prosperously be deliuer'd of.
-I will leaue him,
-And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting
-Betweene him, and my daughter.
-My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly
-Take my leaue of you
-
-   Ham. You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I
-will more willingly part withall, except my life, my
-life
-
-   Polon. Fare you well my Lord
-
-   Ham. These tedious old fooles
-
-   Polon. You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there
-hee is.
-Enter Rosincran and Guildensterne.
-
-  Rosin. God saue you Sir
-
-   Guild. Mine honour'd Lord?
-  Rosin. My most deare Lord?
-  Ham. My excellent good friends? How do'st thou
-Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye
-both?
-  Rosin. As the indifferent Children of the earth
-
-   Guild. Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes
-Cap, we are not the very Button
-
-   Ham. Nor the Soales of her Shoo?
-  Rosin. Neither my Lord
-
-   Ham. Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle
-of her fauour?
-  Guil. Faith, her priuates, we
-
-   Ham. In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true:
-she is a Strumpet. What's the newes?
-  Rosin. None my Lord; but that the World's growne
-honest
-
-   Ham. Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is
-not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue
-you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune,
-that she sends you to Prison hither?
-  Guil. Prison, my Lord?
-  Ham. Denmark's a Prison
-
-   Rosin. Then is the World one
-
-   Ham. A goodly one, in which there are many Confines,
-Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th'
-worst
-
-   Rosin. We thinke not so my Lord
-
-   Ham. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
-either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is
-a prison
-
-   Rosin. Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis
-too narrow for your minde
-
-   Ham. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
-count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that
-I haue bad dreames
-
-   Guil. Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the
-very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow
-of a Dreame
-
-   Ham. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow
-
-   Rosin. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and
-light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow
-
-   Ham. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs
-and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes:
-shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason?
-  Both. Wee'l wait vpon you
-
-   Ham. No such matter. I will not sort you with the
-rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest
-man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten
-way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower?
-  Rosin. To visit you my Lord, no other occasion
-
-   Ham. Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes;
-but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks
-are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it
-your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
-deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake
-
-   Guil. What should we say my Lord?
-  Ham. Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were
-sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes;
-which your modesties haue not craft enough to color,
-I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you
-
-   Rosin. To what end my Lord?
-  Ham. That you must teach me: but let mee coniure
-you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
-our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue,
-and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge
-you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you
-were sent for or no
-
-   Rosin. What say you?
-  Ham. Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me
-hold not off
-
-   Guil. My Lord, we were sent for
-
-   Ham. I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
-preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and
-Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore
-I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise;
-and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition;
-that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill
-Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre,
-look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe,
-fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing
-to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours.
-What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in
-Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing
-how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel?
-in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the
-world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is
-this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no,
-nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme
-to say so
-
-   Rosin. My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my
-thoughts
-
-   Ham. Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights
-not me?
-  Rosin. To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man,
-what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue
-from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are
-they comming to offer you Seruice
-
-   Ham. He that playes the King shall be welcome; his
-Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous
-Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall
-not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in
-peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs
-are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde
-freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players
-are they?
-  Rosin. Euen those you were wont to take delight in
-the Tragedians of the City
-
-   Ham. How chances it they trauaile? their residence
-both in reputation and profit was better both
-wayes
-
-   Rosin. I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes
-of the late Innouation?
-  Ham. Doe they hold the same estimation they did
-when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd?
-  Rosin. No indeed, they are not
-
-   Ham. How comes it? doe they grow rusty?
-  Rosin. Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted
-pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little
-Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and
-are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the
-fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they
-call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of
-Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither
-
-   Ham. What are they Children? Who maintains 'em?
-How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no
-longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards
-if they should grow themselues to common Players (as
-it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers
-do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their
-owne Succession
-
-   Rosin. Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides:
-and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie.
-There was for a while, no mony bid for argument,
-vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in
-the Question
-
-   Ham. Is't possible?
-  Guild. Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of
-Braines
-
-   Ham. Do the Boyes carry it away?
-  Rosin. I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too
-
-   Ham. It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of
-Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him
-while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred
-Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something
-in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could
-finde it out.
-
-Flourish for the Players.
-
-  Guil. There are the Players
-
-   Ham. Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your
-hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion
-and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe,
-lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew
-fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment
-then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father,
-and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd
-
-   Guil. In what my deere Lord?
-  Ham. I am but mad North, North-West: when the
-Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw.
-Enter Polonius.
-
-  Pol. Well be with you Gentlemen
-
-   Ham. Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each
-eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet
-out of his swathing clouts
-
-   Rosin. Happily he's the second time come to them: for
-they say, an old man is twice a childe
-
-   Ham. I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the
-Players. Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning
-'twas so indeed
-
-   Pol. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you
-
-   Ham. My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you.
-When Rossius an Actor in Rome-
-  Pol. The Actors are come hither my Lord
-
-   Ham. Buzze, buzze
-
-   Pol. Vpon mine Honor
-
-   Ham. Then can each Actor on his Asse-
-  Polon. The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie,
-Comedie, Historie, Pastorall:
-Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
-Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall:
-Scene indiuidible: or Poem
-vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus
-too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are
-the onely men
-
-   Ham. O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st
-thou?
-  Pol. What a Treasure had he, my Lord?
-  Ham. Why one faire Daughter, and no more,
-The which he loued passing well
-
-   Pol. Still on my Daughter
-
-   Ham. Am I not i'th' right old Iephta?
-  Polon. If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter
-that I loue passing well
-
-   Ham. Nay that followes not
-
-   Polon. What followes then, my Lord?
-  Ha. Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It
-came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the
-Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my
-Abridgements come.
-Enter foure or fiue Players.
-
-Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see
-thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend?
-Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to
-beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris?
-Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when
-I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God
-your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd
-within the ring. Masters, you are all welcome: wee'l e'ne
-to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l
-haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality:
-come, a passionate speech
-
-   1.Play. What speech, my Lord?
-  Ham. I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
-neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I
-remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the
-Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose
-iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an
-excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe
-with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said,
-there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory;
-nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the
-Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One
-cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale
-to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks
-of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at
-this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like
-th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus
-The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes
-Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble
-When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse,
-Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd
-With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote
-Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd
-With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes,
-Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets,
-That lend a tyrannous, and damned light
-To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire,
-And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore,
-With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
-Olde Grandsire Priam seekes
-
-   Pol. Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent,
-and good discretion
-
-   1.Player. Anon he findes him,
-Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword,
-Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles
-Repugnant to command: vnequall match,
-Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide:
-But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword,
-Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium,
-Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top
-Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash
-Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword
-Which was declining on the Milkie head
-Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke:
-So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood,
-And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing.
-But as we often see against some storme,
-A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still,
-The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below
-As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder
-Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause,
-A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke,
-And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall
-On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne,
-With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword
-Now falles on Priam.
-Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods,
-In generall Synod take away her power:
-Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele,
-And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen,
-As low as to the Fiends
-
-   Pol. This is too long
-
-   Ham. It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee
-say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee
-sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba
-
-   1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen
-
-   Ham. The inobled Queene?
-  Pol. That's good: Inobled Queene is good
-
-   1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe,
-Threatning the flame
-With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head,
-Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe
-About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines,
-A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp.
-Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd,
-'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd?
-But if the Gods themselues did see her then,
-When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
-In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes,
-The instant Burst of Clamour that she made
-(Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all)
-Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen,
-And passion in the Gods
-
-   Pol. Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and
-ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more
-
-   Ham. 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest,
-soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd.
-Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are
-the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After
-your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then
-their ill report while you liued
-
-   Pol. My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart
-
-   Ham. Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man
-after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse
-them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they
-deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them
-in
-
-   Pol. Come sirs.
-
-Exit Polon.
-
-  Ham. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow.
-Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the
-murther of Gonzago?
-  Play. I my Lord
-
-   Ham. Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a
-need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which
-I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not?
-  Play. I my Lord
-
-   Ham. Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you
-mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night
-you are welcome to Elsonower?
-  Rosin. Good my Lord.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Manet Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone.
-Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I?
-Is it not monstrous that this Player heere,
-But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion,
-Could force his soule so to his whole conceit,
-That from her working, all his visage warm'd;
-Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect,
-A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting
-With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing?
-For Hecuba?
-What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
-That he should weepe for her? What would he doe,
-Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion
-That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares,
-And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech:
-Make mad the guilty, and apale the free,
-Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed,
-The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I,
-A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake
-Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause,
-And can say nothing: No, not for a King,
-Vpon whose property, and most deere life,
-A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward?
-Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse?
-Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face?
-Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate,
-As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this?
-Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be,
-But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall
-To make Oppression bitter, or ere this,
-I should haue fatted all the Region Kites
-With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine,
-Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine!
-Oh Vengeance!
-Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue,
-That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered,
-Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell,
-Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words,
-And fall a Cursing like a very Drab.
-A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine.
-I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play,
-Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene,
-Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently
-They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions.
-For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake
-With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players,
-Play something like the murder of my Father,
-Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes,
-Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench
-I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene
-May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power
-T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps
-Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly,
-As he is very potent with such Spirits,
-Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds
-More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing,
-Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King.
-
-Exit
-
-Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
-Guildenstern, and
-Lords.
-
-  King. And can you by no drift of circumstance
-Get from him why he puts on this Confusion:
-Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet
-With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy
-
-   Rosin. He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted,
-But from what cause he will by no meanes speake
-
-   Guil. Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded,
-But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe:
-When we would bring him on to some Confession
-Of his true state
-
-   Qu. Did he receiue you well?
-  Rosin. Most like a Gentleman
-
-   Guild. But with much forcing of his disposition
-
-   Rosin. Niggard of question, but of our demands
-Most free in his reply
-
-   Qu. Did you assay him to any pastime?
-  Rosin. Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players
-We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him,
-And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy
-To heare of it: They are about the Court,
-And (as I thinke) they haue already order
-This night to play before him
-
-   Pol. 'Tis most true:
-And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties
-To heare, and see the matter
-
-   King. With all my heart, and it doth much content me
-To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen,
-Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on
-To these delights
-
-   Rosin. We shall my Lord.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-  King. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too,
-For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither,
-That he, as 'twere by accident, may there
-Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials)
-Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene
-We may of their encounter frankely iudge,
-And gather by him, as he is behaued,
-If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no.
-That thus he suffers for
-
-   Qu. I shall obey you,
-And for your part Ophelia, I do wish
-That your good Beauties be the happy cause
-Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues
-Will bring him to his wonted way againe,
-To both your Honors
-
-   Ophe. Madam, I wish it may
-
-   Pol. Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye
-We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke,
-That shew of such an exercise may colour
-Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this,
-'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage,
-And pious Action, we do surge o're
-The diuell himselfe
-
-   King. Oh 'tis true:
-How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience?
-The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art
-Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it,
-Then is my deede, to my most painted word.
-Oh heauie burthen!
-  Pol. I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
-Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
-The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune,
-Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
-And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe
-No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end
-The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes
-That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
-Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe,
-To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub,
-For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come,
-When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile,
-Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect
-That makes Calamity of so long life:
-For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
-The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
-The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay,
-The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes
-That patient merit of the vnworthy takes,
-When he himselfe might his Quietus make
-With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare
-To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life,
-But that the dread of something after death,
-The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne
-No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
-And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
-Then flye to others that we know not of.
-Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all,
-And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
-Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought,
-And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
-With this regard their Currants turne away,
-And loose the name of Action. Soft you now,
-The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons
-Be all my sinnes remembred
-
-   Ophe. Good my Lord,
-How does your Honor for this many a day?
-  Ham. I humbly thanke you: well, well, well
-
-   Ophe. My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours,
-That I haue longed long to re-deliuer.
-I pray you now, receiue them
-
-   Ham. No, no, I neuer gaue you ought
-
-   Ophe. My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did,
-And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd,
-As made the things more rich, then perfume left:
-Take these againe, for to the Noble minde
-Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde.
-There my Lord
-
-   Ham. Ha, ha: Are you honest?
-  Ophe. My Lord
-
-   Ham. Are you faire?
-  Ophe. What meanes your Lordship?
-  Ham. That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty
-should admit no discourse to your Beautie
-
-   Ophe. Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce
-then your Honestie?
-  Ham. I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner
-transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the
-force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse.
-This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it
-proofe. I did loue you once
-
-   Ophe. Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so
-
-   Ham. You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue
-cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish
-of it. I loued you not
-
-   Ophe. I was the more deceiued
-
-   Ham. Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou
-be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest,
-but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better
-my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull,
-Ambitious, with more offences at my becke,
-then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue
-them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such
-Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth.
-We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy
-wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father?
-  Ophe. At home, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may
-play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell
-
-   Ophe. O helpe him, you sweet Heauens
-
-   Ham. If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague
-for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow,
-thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery.
-Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool:
-for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you
-make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell
-
-   Ophe. O heauenly Powers, restore him
-
-   Ham. I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough.
-God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another:
-you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname
-Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance.
-Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad.
-I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are
-married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep
-as they are. To a Nunnery, go.
-
-Exit Hamlet.
-
-  Ophe. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne?
-The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword,
-Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State,
-The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme,
-Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe.
-Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched,
-That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes:
-Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason,
-Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh,
-That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth,
-Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me,
-T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see.
-Enter King, and Polonius.
-
-  King. Loue? His affections do not that way tend,
-Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little,
-Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule?
-O're which his Melancholly sits on brood,
-And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose
-Will be some danger, which to preuent
-I haue in quicke determination
-Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England
-For the demand of our neglected Tribute:
-Haply the Seas and Countries different
-With variable Obiects, shall expell
-This something setled matter in his heart:
-Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus
-From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't?
-  Pol. It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue
-The Origin and Commencement of this greefe
-Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia?
-You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide,
-We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please,
-But if you hold it fit after the Play,
-Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him
-To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him,
-And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare
-Of all their Conference. If she finde him not,
-To England send him: Or confine him where
-Your wisedome best shall thinke
-
-   King. It shall be so:
-Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Hamlet, and two or three of the Players.
-
-  Ham. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd
-it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it,
-as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer
-had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much
-your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent,
-Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of
-Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that
-may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule,
-to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion
-to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the
-Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of
-nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could
-haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it
-outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it
-
-   Player. I warrant your Honor
-
-   Ham. Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne
-Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word,
-the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance:
-That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any
-thing so ouer-done, is fro[m] the purpose of Playing, whose
-end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer
-the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne
-Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and
-Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this
-ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull
-laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The
-censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway
-a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players
-that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that
-highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing
-the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan,
-or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue
-thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men,
-and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably
-
-   Play. I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with
-vs, Sir
-
-   Ham. O reforme it altogether. And let those that
-play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for
-them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh,
-to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh
-too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question
-of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, &
-shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses
-it. Go make you readie.
-
-Exit Players.
-
-Enter Polonius, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
-
-How now my Lord,
-Will the King heare this peece of Worke?
-  Pol. And the Queene too, and that presently
-
-   Ham. Bid the Players make hast.
-
-Exit Polonius.
-
-Will you two helpe to hasten them?
-  Both. We will my Lord.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Horatio.
-
-  Ham. What hoa, Horatio?
-  Hora. Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice
-
-   Ham. Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man
-As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall
-
-   Hora. O my deere Lord
-
-   Ham. Nay, do not thinke I flatter:
-For what aduancement may I hope from thee,
-That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits
-To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd?
-No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe,
-And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee,
-Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare,
-Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse,
-And could of men distinguish, her election
-Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene
-As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing.
-A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards
-Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those,
-Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled,
-That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger.
-To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man,
-That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him
-In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart,
-As I do thee. Something too much of this.
-There is a Play to night to before the King.
-One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance
-Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death.
-I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot,
-Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule
-Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt,
-Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech,
-It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene:
-And my Imaginations are as foule
-As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note,
-For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face:
-And after we will both our iudgements ioyne,
-To censure of his seeming
-
-   Hora. Well my Lord.
-If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing,
-And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft.
-Enter King, Queene, Polonius, Ophelia, Rosincrance,
-Guildensterne, and
-other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish
-March. Sound
-a Flourish.
-
-  Ham. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle.
-Get you a place
-
-   King. How fares our Cosin Hamlet?
-  Ham. Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate
-the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so
-
-   King. I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these
-words are not mine
-
-   Ham. No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once
-i'th' Vniuersity, you say?
-  Polon. That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good
-Actor
-
-   Ham. And what did you enact?
-  Pol. I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol:
-Brutus kill'd me
-
-   Ham. It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a
-Calfe there. Be the Players ready?
-  Rosin. I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience
-
-   Qu. Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me
-
-   Ha. No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue
-
-   Pol. Oh ho, do you marke that?
-  Ham. Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap?
-  Ophe. No my Lord
-
-   Ham. I meane, my Head vpon your Lap?
-  Ophe. I my Lord
-
-   Ham. Do you thinke I meant Country matters?
-  Ophe. I thinke nothing, my Lord
-
-   Ham. That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs
-  Ophe. What is my Lord?
-  Ham. Nothing
-
-   Ophe. You are merrie, my Lord?
-  Ham. Who I?
-  Ophe. I my Lord
-
-   Ham. Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should
-a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully
-my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two
-Houres
-
-   Ophe. Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord
-
-   Ham. So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke,
-for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths
-ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a
-great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare:
-But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall
-he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose
-Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot.
-
-Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters.
-
-Enter a King and Queene, very louingly; the Queene embracing
-him. She
-kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her
-vp, and
-declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke
-of Flowers.
-She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow,
-takes off his
-Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and
-Exits. The
-Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate
-Action. The
-Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming
-to lament
-with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the
-Queene with
-Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end,
-accepts his
-loue.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-  Ophe. What meanes this, my Lord?
-  Ham. Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes
-Mischeefe
-
-   Ophe. Belike this shew imports the Argument of the
-Play?
-  Ham. We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players
-cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all
-
-   Ophe. Will they tell vs what this shew meant?
-  Ham. I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not
-you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it
-meanes
-
-   Ophe. You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the
-Play.
-Enter Prologue.
-
-For vs, and for our Tragedie,
-Heere stooping to your Clemencie:
-We begge your hearing Patientlie
-
-   Ham. Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring?
-  Ophe. 'Tis briefe my Lord
-
-   Ham. As Womans loue.
-Enter King and his Queene.
-
-  King. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round,
-Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground:
-And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene,
-About the World haue times twelue thirties beene,
-Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands
-Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands
-
-   Bap. So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone
-Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done.
-But woe is me, you are so sicke of late,
-So farre from cheere, and from your former state,
-That I distrust you: yet though I distrust,
-Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must:
-For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie,
-In neither ought, or in extremity:
-Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know,
-And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so
-
-   King. Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too:
-My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do:
-And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde,
-Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde.
-For Husband shalt thou-
-  Bap. Oh confound the rest:
-Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest:
-In second Husband, let me be accurst,
-None wed the second, but who kill'd the first
-
-   Ham. Wormwood, Wormwood
-
-   Bapt. The instances that second Marriage moue,
-Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue.
-A second time, I kill my Husband dead,
-When second Husband kisses me in Bed
-
-   King. I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak:
-But what we do determine, oft we breake:
-Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie,
-Of violent Birth, but poore validitie:
-Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree,
-But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee.
-Most necessary 'tis, that we forget
-To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt:
-What to our selues in passion we propose,
-The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
-The violence of other Greefe or Ioy,
-Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy:
-Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament;
-Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident.
-This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
-That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change.
-For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue,
-Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue.
-The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies,
-The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies:
-And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend,
-For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend:
-And who in want a hollow Friend doth try,
-Directly seasons him his Enemie.
-But orderly to end, where I begun,
-Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run,
-That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne,
-Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne.
-So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed.
-But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead
+Pol.
+Give o'er the play.
 
-   Bap. Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light,
-Sport and repose locke from me day and night:
-Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy,
-Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy:
-Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife,
-If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife
+King.
+Give me some light:--away!
 
-   Ham. If she should breake it now
+All.
+Lights, lights, lights!
 
-   King. 'Tis deepely sworne:
-Sweet, leaue me heere a while,
-My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile
-The tedious day with sleepe
+[Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio.]
 
-   Qu. Sleepe rocke thy Braine,
+Ham.
+   Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
+     The hart ungalled play;
+   For some must watch, while some must sleep:
+     So runs the world away.--
+Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers--if the rest of my
+fortunes turn Turk with me,--with two Provincial roses on my
+razed shoes, get me a fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
 
-Sleepes
+Hor.
+Half a share.
 
-And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine.
+Ham.
+     A whole one, I.
+   For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
+     This realm dismantled was
+   Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
+     A very, very--pajock.
 
-Exit
+Hor.
+You might have rhymed.
 
-  Ham. Madam, how like you this Play?
-  Qu. The Lady protests to much me thinkes
+Ham.
+O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a thousand
+pound! Didst perceive?
 
-   Ham. Oh but shee'l keepe her word
+Hor.
+Very well, my lord.
 
-   King. Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence
-in't?
-  Ham. No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence
-i'th' world
+Ham.
+Upon the talk of the poisoning?--
 
-   King. What do you call the Play?
-  Ham. The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically:
-This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago
-is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see
-anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that?
-Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches
-vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung.
-Enter Lucianus.
+Hor.
+I did very well note him.
 
-This is one Lucianus nephew to the King
+Ham.
+Ah, ha!--Come, some music! Come, the recorders!--
+   For if the king like not the comedy,
+   Why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.
+Come, some music!
 
-   Ophe. You are a good Chorus, my Lord
+[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
 
-   Ham. I could interpret betweene you and your loue:
-if I could see the Puppets dallying
+Guil.
+Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
 
-   Ophe. You are keene my Lord, you are keene
+Ham.
+Sir, a whole history.
 
-   Ham. It would cost you a groaning, to take off my
-edge
+Guil.
+The king, sir--
 
-   Ophe. Still better and worse
+Ham.
+Ay, sir, what of him?
 
-   Ham. So you mistake Husbands.
-Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and
-begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge
+Guil.
+Is, in his retirement, marvellous distempered.
 
-   Lucian. Thoughts blacke, hands apt,
-Drugges fit, and Time agreeing:
-Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing:
-Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected,
-With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected,
-Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie,
-On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately.
+Ham.
+With drink, sir?
 
-Powres the poyson in his eares.
+Guil.
+No, my lord; rather with choler.
 
-  Ham. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His
-name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce
-Italian. You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the
-loue of Gonzago's wife
+Ham.
+Your wisdom should show itself more richer to signify this to
+the doctor; for me to put him to his purgation would perhaps
+plunge him into far more choler.
 
-   Ophe. The King rises
+Guil.
+Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame, and start
+not so wildly from my affair.
 
-   Ham. What, frighted with false fire
+Ham.
+I am tame, sir:--pronounce.
 
-   Qu. How fares my Lord?
-  Pol. Giue o're the Play
+Guil.
+The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of spirit,
+hath sent me to you.
 
-   King. Giue me some Light. Away
+Ham.
+You are welcome.
 
-   All. Lights, Lights, Lights.
+Guil.
+Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right breed.
+If it shall please you to make me a wholesome answer, I will do
+your mother's commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
+shall be the end of my business.
 
-Exeunt.
+Ham.
+Sir, I cannot.
 
-Manet Hamlet & Horatio.
+Guil.
+What, my lord?
 
-  Ham. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe,
-The Hart vngalled play:
-For some must watch, while some must sleepe;
-So runnes the world away.
-Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of
-my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall
-Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie
-of Players sir
+Ham.
+Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but, sir, such
+answer as I can make, you shall command; or rather, as you say,
+my mother: therefore no more, but to the matter: my mother, you
+say,--
 
-   Hor. Halfe a share
+Ros.
+Then thus she says: your behaviour hath struck her into
+amazement and admiration.
 
-   Ham. A whole one I,
-For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere,
-This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe,
-And now reignes heere.
-A verie verie Paiocke
+Ham.
+O wonderful son, that can so stonish a mother!--But is there no
+sequel at the heels of this mother's admiration?
 
-   Hora. You might haue Rim'd
+Ros.
+She desires to speak with you in her closet ere you go to bed.
 
-   Ham. Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for
-a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue?
-  Hora. Verie well my Lord
+Ham.
+We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have you any
+further trade with us?
 
-   Ham. Vpon the talke of the poysoning?
-  Hora. I did verie well note him.
-Enter Rosincrance and Guildensterne.
+Ros.
+My lord, you once did love me.
 
-  Ham. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders:
-For if the King like not the Comedie,
-Why then belike he likes it not perdie.
-Come some Musicke
+Ham.
+And so I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
 
-   Guild. Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you
+Ros.
+Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you do, surely,
+bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to
+your friend.
 
-   Ham. Sir, a whole History
+Ham.
+Sir, I lack advancement.
 
-   Guild. The King, sir
+Ros.
+How can that be, when you have the voice of the king himself
+for your succession in Denmark?
 
-   Ham. I sir, what of him?
-  Guild. Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd
+Ham.
+Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'--the proverb is something
+musty.
 
-   Ham. With drinke Sir?
-  Guild. No my Lord, rather with choller
+[Re-enter the Players, with recorders.]
 
-   Ham. Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer,
-to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him
-to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre
-more Choller
+O, the recorders:--let me see one.--To withdraw with you:--why do
+you go about to recover the wind of me, as if you would drive me
+into a toil?
 
-   Guild. Good my Lord put your discourse into some
-frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre
+Guil.
+O my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too unmannerly.
 
-   Ham. I am tame Sir, pronounce
+Ham.
+I do not well understand that. Will you play upon this pipe?
 
-   Guild. The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction
-of spirit, hath sent me to you
+Guil.
+My lord, I cannot.
 
-   Ham. You are welcome
+Ham.
+I pray you.
 
-   Guild. Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of
-the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome
-answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment:
-if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of
-my Businesse
+Guil.
+Believe me, I cannot.
 
-   Ham. Sir, I cannot
+Ham.
+I do beseech you.
 
-   Guild. What, my Lord?
-  Ham. Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd.
-But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command:
-or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more
-but to the matter. My Mother you say
+Guil.
+I know, no touch of it, my lord.
 
-   Rosin. Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke
-her into amazement, and admiration
+Ham.
+'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with your
+finger and thumb, give it breath with your mouth, and it will
+discourse most eloquent music. Look you, these are the stops.
 
-   Ham. Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a
-Mother. But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers
-admiration?
-  Rosin. She desires to speake with you in her Closset,
-ere you go to bed
+Guil.
+But these cannot I command to any utterance of harmony; I
+have not the skill.
 
-   Ham. We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother.
-Haue you any further Trade with vs?
-  Rosin. My Lord, you once did loue me
+Ham.
+Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of me! You
+would play upon me; you would seem to know my stops; you would
+pluck out the heart of my mystery; you would sound me from my
+lowest note to the top of my compass; and there is much music,
+excellent voice, in this little organ, yet cannot you make it
+speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am easier to be played on than a
+pipe? Call me what instrument you will, though you can fret me,
+you cannot play upon me.
 
-   Ham. So I do still, by these pickers and stealers
+[Enter Polonius.]
 
-   Rosin. Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper?
-You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie,
-if you deny your greefes to your Friend
+God bless you, sir!
 
-   Ham. Sir I lacke Aduancement
+Pol.
+My lord, the queen would speak with you, and presently.
 
-   Rosin. How can that be, when you haue the voyce of
-the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke?
-  Ham. I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is
-something musty.
-Enter one with a Recorder.
+Ham.
+Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
 
-O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why
-do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you
-would driue me into a toyle?
-  Guild. O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue
-is too vnmannerly
+Pol.
+By the mass, and 'tis like a camel indeed.
 
-   Ham. I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play
-vpon this Pipe?
-  Guild. My Lord, I cannot
+Ham.
+Methinks it is like a weasel.
 
-   Ham. I pray you
+Pol.
+It is backed like a weasel.
 
-   Guild. Beleeue me, I cannot
+Ham.
+Or like a whale.
 
-   Ham. I do beseech you
+Pol.
+Very like a whale.
 
-   Guild. I know no touch of it, my Lord
+Ham.
+Then will I come to my mother by and by.--They fool me to the
+top of my bent.--I will come by and by.
 
-   Ham. 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges
-with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your
-mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke.
-Looke you, these are the stoppes
+Pol.
+I will say so.
 
-   Guild. But these cannot I command to any vtterance
-of hermony, I haue not the skill
+[Exit.]
 
-   Ham. Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing
-you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would
-seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart
-of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest
-Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke,
-excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot
-you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee
-plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will,
-though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God
-blesse you Sir.
-Enter Polonius.
+Ham.
+By-and-by is easily said.
 
-  Polon. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you,
-and presently
+[Exit Polonius.]
 
-   Ham. Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape
-like a Camell
+--Leave me, friends.
 
-   Polon. By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed
+[Exeunt Ros, Guil., Hor., and Players.]
 
-   Ham. Me thinkes it is like a Weazell
+'Tis now the very witching time of night,
+When churchyards yawn, and hell itself breathes out
+Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
+And do such bitter business as the day
+Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.--
+O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
+The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
+Let me be cruel, not unnatural;
+I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
+My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites,--
+How in my words somever she be shent,
+To give them seals never, my soul, consent!
 
-   Polon. It is back'd like a Weazell
+[Exit.]
 
-   Ham. Or like a Whale?
-  Polon. Verie like a Whale
 
-   Ham. Then will I come to my Mother, by and by:
-They foole me to the top of my bent.
-I will come by and by
 
-   Polon. I will say so.
-Enter.
+Scene III. A room in the Castle.
 
-  Ham. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends:
-'Tis now the verie witching time of night,
-When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out
-Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
-And do such bitter businesse as the day
-Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother:
-Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer
-The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome:
-Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall,
-I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none:
-My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites.
-How in my words someuer she be shent,
-To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent.
-Enter King, Rosincrance, and Guildensterne.
+[Enter King, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern.]
 
-  King. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs,
-To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you,
-I your Commission will forthwith dispatch,
+King.
+I like him not; nor stands it safe with us
+To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
+I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
 And he to England shall along with you:
-The termes of our estate, may not endure
-Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow
-Out of his Lunacies
-
-   Guild. We will our selues prouide:
-Most holie and Religious feare it is
-To keepe those many many bodies safe
-That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie
-
-   Rosin. The single
-And peculiar life is bound
-With all the strength and Armour of the minde,
-To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more,
-That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests
-The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie
-Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw
-What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele
-Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount.
-To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things
-Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles,
-Each small annexment, pettie consequence
-Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone
-Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone
-
-   King. Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage;
-For we will Fetters put vpon this feare,
-Which now goes too free-footed
-
-   Both. We will haste vs.
-
-Exeunt. Gent.
-
-Enter Polonius.
-
-  Pol. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset:
-Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe
-To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home,
-And as you said, and wisely was it said,
-'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother,
-Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare
-The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege,
-Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed,
-And tell you what I know
-
-   King. Thankes deere my Lord.
-Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen,
-It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't,
-A Brothers murther. Pray can I not,
-Though inclination be as sharpe as will:
-My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent,
-And like a man to double businesse bound,
+The terms of our estate may not endure
+Hazard so near us as doth hourly grow
+Out of his lunacies.
+
+Guil.
+We will ourselves provide:
+Most holy and religious fear it is
+To keep those many many bodies safe
+That live and feed upon your majesty.
+
+Ros.
+The single and peculiar life is bound,
+With all the strength and armour of the mind,
+To keep itself from 'noyance; but much more
+That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
+The lives of many. The cease of majesty
+Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw
+What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
+Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
+To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
+Are mortis'd and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
+Each small annexment, petty consequence,
+Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
+Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
+
+King.
+Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
+For we will fetters put upon this fear,
+Which now goes too free-footed.
+
+Ros and Guil.
+We will haste us.
+
+[Exeunt Ros. and Guil.]
+
+[Enter Polonius.]
+
+Pol.
+My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
+Behind the arras I'll convey myself
+To hear the process; I'll warrant she'll tax him home:
+And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
+'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
+Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
+The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
+I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
+And tell you what I know.
+
+King.
+Thanks, dear my lord.
+
+[Exit Polonius.]
+
+O, my offence is rank, it smells to heaven;
+It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,--
+A brother's murder!--Pray can I not,
+Though inclination be as sharp as will:
+My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
+And, like a man to double business bound,
 I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
-And both neglect; what if this cursed hand
-Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood,
-Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
-To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy,
-But to confront the visage of Offence?
-And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force,
-To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall,
-Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp,
-My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer
-Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther:
-That cannot be, since I am still possest
-Of those effects for which I did the Murther.
-My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene:
-May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence?
-In the corrupted currants of this world,
-Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice,
-And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe
-Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue,
-There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes
-In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd
-Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
-To giue in euidence. What then? What rests?
-Try what Repentance can. What can it not?
-Yet what can it, when one cannot repent?
-Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death!
-Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free,
-Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay:
-Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele,
-Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe,
+And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
+Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,--
+Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
+To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
+But to confront the visage of offence?
+And what's in prayer but this twofold force,--
+To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
+Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
+My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
+Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder!--
+That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
+Of those effects for which I did the murder,--
+My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
+May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
+In the corrupted currents of this world
+Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice;
+And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
+Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above;
+There is no shuffling;--there the action lies
+In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
+Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
+To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
+Try what repentance can: what can it not?
+Yet what can it when one cannot repent?
+O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
+O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
+Art more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:
+Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of steel,
+Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!
 All may be well.
-Enter Hamlet.
 
-  Ham. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying,
-And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen,
-And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd,
-A Villaine killes my Father, and for that
-I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send
-To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge.
-He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread,
-With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May,
-And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen:
-But in our circumstance and course of thought
-'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd,
-To take him in the purging of his Soule,
-When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.
-Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent
-When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage,
-Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed,
-At gaming, swearing, or about some acte
-That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't,
-Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen,
-And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke
-As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes,
-This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes.
-Enter.
-
-  King. My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below,
-Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go.
-Enter.
-
-Enter Queene and Polonius.
-
-  Pol. He will come straight:
-Looke you lay home to him,
-Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with,
-And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene
-Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere:
-Pray you be round with him
-
-   Ham. within. Mother, mother, mother
-
-   Qu. Ile warrant you, feare me not.
-Withdraw, I heare him coming.
-Enter Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. Now Mother, what's the matter?
-  Qu. Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended
-
-
-   Ham. Mother, you haue my Father much offended
-
-   Qu. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue
-
-   Ham. Go, go, you question with an idle tongue
-
-   Qu. Why how now Hamlet?
-  Ham. Whats the matter now?
-  Qu. Haue you forgot me?
-  Ham. No by the Rood, not so:
-You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife,
-But would you were not so. You are my Mother
-
-   Qu. Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake
-
-   Ham. Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not
-boudge:
-You go not till I set you vp a glasse,
-Where you may see the inmost part of you?
-  Qu. What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me?
-Helpe, helpe, hoa
-
-   Pol. What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe
-
-   Ham. How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead
-
-   Pol. Oh I am slaine.
-
-Killes Polonius
-
-   Qu. Oh me, what hast thou done?
-  Ham. Nay I know not, is it the King?
-  Qu. Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this?
-  Ham. A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother,
-As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother
-
-   Qu. As kill a King?
-  Ham. I Lady, 'twas my word.
-Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell,
-I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune,
-Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger.
-Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe,
-And let me wring your heart, for so I shall
-If it be made of penetrable stuffe;
-If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so,
-That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense
+[Retires and kneels.]
 
-   Qu. What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong,
-In noise so rude against me?
-  Ham. Such an Act
-That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie,
-Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose
-From the faire forehead of an innocent loue,
-And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes
-As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed,
-As from the body of Contraction pluckes
-The very soule, and sweete Religion makes
-A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow,
-Yea this solidity and compound masse,
-With tristfull visage as against the doome,
-Is thought-sicke at the act
-
-   Qu. Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders
-in the Index
-
-   Ham. Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this,
-The counterfet presentment of two Brothers:
-See what a grace was seated on his Brow,
-Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe,
-An eye like Mars, to threaten or command
-A Station, like the Herald Mercurie
-New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill:
-A Combination, and a forme indeed,
-Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale,
-To giue the world assurance of a man.
-This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes.
-Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare
-Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes?
-Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed,
-And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes?
-You cannot call it Loue: For at your age,
-The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
-And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement
-Would step from this, to this? What diuell was't,
-That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde?
-O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell,
-If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones,
-To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe.
-And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame,
-When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge,
-Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne,
-As Reason panders Will
-
-   Qu. O Hamlet, speake no more.
-Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule,
-And there I see such blacke and grained spots,
-As will not leaue their Tinct
-
-   Ham. Nay, but to liue
-In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed,
-Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue
-Ouer the nasty Stye
-
-   Qu. Oh speake to me, no more,
-These words like Daggers enter in mine eares.
-No more sweet Hamlet
-
-   Ham. A Murderer, and a Villaine:
-A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe
-Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings,
-A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule.
-That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole,
-And put it in his Pocket
-
-   Qu. No more.
-Enter Ghost.
-
-  Ham. A King of shreds and patches.
-Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings
-You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure?
-  Qu. Alas he's mad
-
-   Ham. Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide,
-That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by
-Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say
+[Enter Hamlet.]
 
-   Ghost. Do not forget: this Visitation
-Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
-But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits;
-O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule,
-Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes.
-Speake to her Hamlet
-
-   Ham. How is it with you Lady?
-  Qu. Alas, how is't with you?
-That you bend your eye on vacancie,
-And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse.
-Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe,
-And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme,
-Your bedded haire, like life in excrements,
-Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne,
-Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper
-Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke?
-  Ham. On him, on him: look you how pale he glares,
-His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones,
-Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me,
-Least with this pitteous action you conuert
-My sterne effects: then what I haue to do,
-Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood
-
-   Qu. To who do you speake this?
-  Ham. Do you see nothing there?
-  Qu. Nothing at all, yet all that is I see
-
-   Ham. Nor did you nothing heare?
-  Qu. No, nothing but our selues
-
-   Ham. Why look you there: looke how it steals away:
-My Father in his habite, as he liued,
-Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall.
-Enter.
-
-  Qu. This is the very coynage of your Braine,
-This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in
-
-   Ham. Extasie?
-My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time,
-And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse
-That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test
-And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse
-Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace,
-Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule,
-That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes:
-It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place,
-Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within,
-Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen,
-Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come,
-And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes,
-To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue,
-For in the fatnesse of this pursie times,
-Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge,
-Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good
-
-   Qu. Oh Hamlet,
-Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine
-
-   Ham. O throw away the worser part of it,
-And liue the purer with the other halfe.
-Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed,
-Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night,
-And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse
-To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight,
-And when you are desirous to be blest,
-Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord,
-I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so,
-To punish me with this, and this with me,
-That I must be their Scourge and Minister.
-I will bestow him, and will answer well
-The death I gaue him: so againe, good night.
-I must be cruell, onely to be kinde;
-Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde
-
-   Qu. What shall I do?
-  Ham. Not this by no meanes that I bid you do:
-Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed,
-Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse,
-And let him for a paire of reechie kisses,
-Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers,
-Make you to rauell all this matter out,
-That I essentially am not in madnesse,
-But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know,
-For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise,
-Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe,
-Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so,
-No in despight of Sense and Secrecie,
-Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top:
-Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape
-To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe
-And breake your owne necke downe
-
-   Qu. Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
-And breath of life: I haue no life to breath
-What thou hast saide to me
-
-   Ham. I must to England, you know that?
-  Qu. Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on
-
-   Ham. This man shall set me packing:
-Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome,
-Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor
-Is now most still, most secret, and most graue,
-Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue.
-Come sir, to draw toward an end with you.
-Good night Mother.
-Exit Hamlet tugging in Polonius.
-
-Enter King.
-
-  King. There's matters in these sighes.
-These profound heaues
-You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them.
-Where is your Sonne?
-  Qu. Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night?
-  King. What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet?
-  Qu. Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend
-Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit
-Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre,
-He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat,
-And in his brainish apprehension killes
-The vnseene good old man
-
-   King. Oh heauy deed:
-It had bin so with vs had we beene there:
-His Liberty is full of threats to all,
-To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one.
-Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered?
-It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence
-Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt,
-This mad yong man. But so much was our loue,
-We would not vnderstand what was most fit,
-But like the Owner of a foule disease,
-To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede
-Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
-  Qu. To draw apart the body he hath kild,
-O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare
-Among a Minerall of Mettels base
-Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done
-
-   King. Oh Gertrude, come away:
-The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch,
-But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed,
-We must with all our Maiesty and Skill
-Both countenance, and excuse.
-Enter Ros. & Guild.
-
-Ho Guildenstern:
-Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde:
-Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine,
-And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him.
-Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body
-Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this.
-Exit Gent.
-
-Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends,
-To let them know both what we meane to do,
-And what's vntimely done. Oh come away,
-My soule is full of discord and dismay.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Hamlet.
-
-  Ham. Safely stowed
-
-   Gentlemen within. Hamlet, Lord Hamlet
-
-   Ham. What noise? Who cals on Hamlet?
-Oh heere they come.
-Enter Ros. and Guildensterne.
-
-  Ro. What haue you done my Lord with the dead body?
-  Ham. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne
-
-   Rosin. Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
-And beare it to the Chappell
-
-   Ham. Do not beleeue it
-
-   Rosin. Beleeue what?
-  Ham. That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine
-owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication
-should be made by the Sonne of a King
-
-   Rosin. Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord?
-  Ham. I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his
-Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King
-best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in
-the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed,
-when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing
-you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe
-
-   Rosin. I vnderstand you not my Lord
-
-   Ham. I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a
-foolish eare
-
-   Rosin. My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is,
-and go with vs to the King
-
-   Ham. The body is with the King, but the King is not
-with the body. The King, is a thing-
-  Guild. A thing my Lord?
-  Ham. Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all
-after.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter King.
-
-  King. I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie:
-How dangerous is it that this man goes loose:
-Yet must not we put the strong Law on him:
-Hee's loued of the distracted multitude,
-Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes:
-And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd
-But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen,
-This sodaine sending him away, must seeme
-Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne,
-By desperate appliance are releeued,
-Or not at all.
-Enter Rosincrane.
+Ham.
+Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
+And now I'll do't;--and so he goes to heaven;
+And so am I reveng'd.--that would be scann'd:
+A villain kills my father; and for that,
+I, his sole son, do this same villain send
+To heaven.
+O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
+He took my father grossly, full of bread;
+With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
+And how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?
+But in our circumstance and course of thought,
+'Tis heavy with him: and am I, then, reveng'd,
+To take him in the purging of his soul,
+When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
+No.
+Up, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:
+When he is drunk asleep; or in his rage;
+Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
+At gaming, swearing; or about some act
+That has no relish of salvation in't;--
+Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven;
+And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
+As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
+This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
 
-How now? What hath befalne?
-  Rosin. Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord,
-We cannot get from him
-
-   King. But where is he?
-  Rosin. Without my Lord, guarded to know your
-pleasure
-
-   King. Bring him before vs
-
-   Rosin. Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord.
-Enter Hamlet and Guildensterne.
-
-  King. Now Hamlet, where's Polonius?
-  Ham. At Supper
-
-   King. At Supper? Where?
-  Ham. Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine
-conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm
-is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else
-to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King,
-and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes,
-but to one Table that's the end
-
-   King. What dost thou meane by this?
-  Ham. Nothing but to shew you how a King may go
-a Progresse through the guts of a Begger
-
-   King. Where is Polonius
-
-   Ham. In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger
-finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your
-selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you
-shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby
-
-   King. Go seeke him there
-
-   Ham. He will stay till ye come
-
-   K. Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety
-Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue
-For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence
-With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe,
-The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe,
-Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent
-For England
-
-   Ham. For England?
-  King. I Hamlet
-
-   Ham. Good
-
-   King. So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes
-
-   Ham. I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for
-England. Farewell deere Mother
-
-   King. Thy louing Father Hamlet
-
-   Hamlet. My Mother: Father and Mother is man and
-wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come,
-for England.
-
-Exit
-
-  King. Follow him at foote,
-Tempt him with speed aboord:
-Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night.
-Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done
-That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast.
-And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought,
-As my great power thereof may giue thee sense,
-Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red
-After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe
-Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set
-Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full
-By Letters coniuring to that effect
-The present death of Hamlet. Do it England,
-For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages,
-And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done,
-How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun.
-
-Exit
-
-Enter Fortinbras with an Armie.
-
-  For. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King,
-Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras
-Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March
-Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous:
-If that his Maiesty would ought with vs,
-We shall expresse our dutie in his eye,
-And let him know so
-
-   Cap. I will doo't, my Lord
-
-   For. Go safely on.
-Enter.
-
-Enter Queene and Horatio.
-
-  Qu. I will not speake with her
-
-   Hor. She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode
-will needs be pittied
-
-   Qu. What would she haue?
-  Hor. She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares
-There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart,
-Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt,
-That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing,
-Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue
-The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it,
-And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts,
-Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them,
-Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought,
-Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily
-
-   Qu. 'Twere good she were spoken with,
-For she may strew dangerous coniectures
-In ill breeding minds. Let her come in.
-To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is)
-Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse,
-So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt,
-It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt.
-Enter Ophelia distracted.
-
-  Ophe. Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark
-
-   Qu. How now Ophelia?
-  Ophe. How should I your true loue know from another one?
-By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone
-
-   Qu. Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song?
-  Ophe. Say you? Nay pray you marke.
-He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone,
-At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone.
-Enter King.
-
-  Qu. Nay but Ophelia
-
-   Ophe. Pray you marke.
-White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow
-
-   Qu. Alas, looke heere my Lord
-
-   Ophe. Larded with sweet Flowers:
-Which bewept to the graue did not go,
-With true-loue showres
-
-   King. How do ye, pretty Lady?
-  Ophe. Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was
-a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but
-know not what we may be. God be at your Table
-
-   King. Conceit vpon her Father
-
-   Ophe. Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when
-they aske you what it meanes, say you this:
-To morrow is S[aint]. Valentines day, all in the morning betime,
-And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine.
-Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore,
-Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more
-
-   King. Pretty Ophelia
-
-   Ophe. Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont.
-By gis, and by S[aint]. Charity,
-Alacke, and fie for shame:
-Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't,
-By Cocke they are too blame.
-Quoth she before you tumbled me,
-You promis'd me to Wed:
-So would I ha done by yonder Sunne,
-And thou hadst not come to my bed
-
-   King. How long hath she bin thus?
-  Ophe. I hope all will be well. We must bee patient,
-but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should
-lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it,
-and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my
-Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies:
-Goodnight, goodnight.
-Enter.
-
-  King. Follow her close,
-Giue her good watch I pray you:
-Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs
-All from her Fathers death. Oh Gertrude, Gertrude,
-When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies,
-But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine,
-Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author
-Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied,
-Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers
-For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly
-In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia
-Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement,
-Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts.
-Last, and as much containing as all these,
-Her Brother is in secret come from France,
-Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds,
-And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare
-With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death,
-Where in necessitie of matter Beggard,
-Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne
-In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this,
-Like to a murdering Peece in many places,
-Giues me superfluous death.
-
-A Noise within.
-
-Enter a Messenger.
-
-  Qu. Alacke, what noyse is this?
-  King. Where are my Switzers?
-Let them guard the doore. What is the matter?
-  Mes. Saue your selfe, my Lord.
-The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List)
-Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste
-Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head,
-Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord,
-And as the world were now but to begin,
-Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne,
-The Ratifiers and props of euery word,
-They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King,
-Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds,
-Laertes shall be King, Laertes King
-
-   Qu. How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry,
-Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges.
-
-Noise within. Enter Laertes.
-
-  King. The doores are broke
-
-   Laer. Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without
-
-   All. No, let's come in
-
-   Laer. I pray you giue me leaue
-
-   Al. We will, we will
-
-   Laer. I thanke you: Keepe the doore.
-Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father
-
-   Qu. Calmely good Laertes
-
-   Laer. That drop of blood, that calmes
-Proclaimes me Bastard:
-Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot
-Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow
-Of my true Mother
-
-   King. What is the cause Laertes,
-That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like?
-Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person:
-There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King,
-That Treason can but peepe to what it would,
-Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes,
-Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude.
-Speake man
-
-   Laer. Where's my Father?
-  King. Dead
-
-   Qu. But not by him
-
-   King. Let him demand his fill
-
-   Laer. How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with.
-To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell.
-Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit.
-I dare Damnation: to this point I stand,
-That both the worlds I giue to negligence,
-Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd
-Most throughly for my Father
-
-   King. Who shall stay you?
-  Laer. My Will, not all the world,
-And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well,
-They shall go farre with little
-
-   King. Good Laertes:
-If you desire to know the certaintie
-Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge,
-That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe,
-Winner and Looser
-
-   Laer. None but his Enemies
-
-   King. Will you know them then
-
-   La. To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes:
-And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician,
-Repast them with my blood
-
-   King. Why now you speake
-Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman.
-That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death,
-And am most sensible in greefe for it,
-It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce
-As day do's to your eye.
-
-A noise within. Let her come in.
-
-Enter Ophelia.
-
-  Laer. How now? what noise is that?
-Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt,
-Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye.
-By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight,
-Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May,
-Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia:
-Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits,
-Should be as mortall as an old mans life?
-Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine,
-It sends some precious instance of it selfe
-After the thing it loues
-
-   Ophe. They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer,
-Hey non nony, nony, hey nony:
-And on his graue raines many a teare,
-Fare you well my Doue
-
-   Laer. Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge,
-it could not moue thus
-
-   Ophe. You must sing downe a-downe, and you call
-him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is
-the false Steward that stole his masters daughter
-
-   Laer. This nothings more then matter
-
-   Ophe. There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce.
-Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for
-Thoughts
-
-   Laer. A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance
-fitted
-
-   Ophe. There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's
-Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it
-Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew
-with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you
-some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed:
-They say, he made a good end;
-For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy
-
-   Laer. Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe:
-She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse
-
-   Ophe. And will he not come againe,
-And will he not come againe:
-No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed,
-He neuer wil come againe.
-His Beard as white as Snow,
-All Flaxen was his Pole:
-He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone,
-Gramercy on his Soule.
-And of all Christian Soules, I pray God.
-God buy ye.
-
-Exeunt. Ophelia
-
-  Laer. Do you see this, you Gods?
-  King. Laertes, I must common with your greefe,
-Or you deny me right: go but apart,
-Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will,
-And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me;
-If by direct or by Colaterall hand
-They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue,
-Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours
-To you in satisfaction. But if not,
-Be you content to lend your patience to vs,
-And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule
-To giue it due content
-
-   Laer. Let this be so:
-His meanes of death, his obscure buriall;
-No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones,
-No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation,
-Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth,
-That I must call in question
+[Exit.]
 
-   King. So you shall:
-And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall.
-I pray you go with me.
+[The King rises and advances.]
 
-Exeunt.
+King.
+My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
+Words without thoughts never to heaven go.
 
-Enter Horatio, with an Attendant.
+[Exit.]
 
-  Hora. What are they that would speake with me?
-  Ser. Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you
 
-   Hor. Let them come in,
-I do not know from what part of the world
-I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
-Enter Saylor.
 
-  Say. God blesse you Sir
+Scene IV. Another room in the castle.
 
-   Hor. Let him blesse thee too
+[Enter Queen and Polonius.]
 
-   Say. Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter
-for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was
-bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let
-to know it is.
-
-Reads the Letter.
-
-Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these
-Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters
-for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very
-Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too
-slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I
-boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so
-I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like
-Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe
-a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue
-sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest
-flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee
-dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter.
-These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance
-and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them
-I haue much to tell thee, Farewell.
-He that thou knowest thine,
-Hamlet.
-Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters,
-And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
-To him from whom you brought them.
-Enter.
+Pol.
+He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
+Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
+And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
+Much heat and him. I'll silence me e'en here.
+Pray you, be round with him.
 
-Enter King and Laertes.
+Ham.
+[Within.] Mother, mother, mother!
 
-  King. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
-And you must put me in your heart for Friend,
-Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare,
-That he which hath your Noble Father slaine,
-Pursued my life
-
-   Laer. It well appeares. But tell me,
-Why you proceeded not against these feates,
-So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature,
-As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else,
-You mainly were stirr'd vp?
-  King. O for two speciall Reasons,
-Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed,
-And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother,
-Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe,
-My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which,
-She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule;
-That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere,
-I could not but by her. The other Motiue,
-Why to a publike count I might not go,
-Is the great loue the generall gender beare him,
-Who dipping all his Faults in their affection,
-Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone,
-Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes
-Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde,
-Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe,
-And not where I had arm'd them
-
-   Laer. And so haue I a Noble Father lost,
-A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes,
-Who was (if praises may go backe againe)
-Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age
-For her perfections. But my reuenge will come
-
-   King. Breake not your sleepes for that,
-You must not thinke
-That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull,
-That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger,
-And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more,
-I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe,
-And that I hope will teach you to imagine-
-Enter a Messenger.
-
-How now? What Newes?
-  Mes. Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your
-Maiesty: this to the Queene
-
-   King. From Hamlet? Who brought them?
-  Mes. Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not:
-They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them
-
-   King. Laertes you shall heare them:
-Leaue vs.
-
-Exit Messenger
-
-High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your
-Kingdome. To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly
-Eyes. When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount
-th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne.
-Hamlet.
-What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe?
-Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing?
-  Laer. Know you the hand?
-  Kin. 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript
-here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me?
-  Laer. I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come,
-It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart,
-That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth;
-Thus diddest thou
-
-   Kin. If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so:
-How otherwise will you be rul'd by me?
-  Laer. If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace
-
-   Kin. To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd,
-As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes
-No more to vndertake it; I will worke him
-To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice,
-Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall;
-And for his death no winde of blame shall breath,
-But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice,
-And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence
-Here was a Gentleman of Normandy,
-I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French,
-And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant
-Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat,
-And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse,
-As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd
-With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought,
-That I in forgery of shapes and trickes,
-Come short of what he did
-
-   Laer. A Norman was't?
-  Kin. A Norman
-
-   Laer. Vpon my life Lamound
-
-   Kin. The very same
-
-   Laer. I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed,
-And Iemme of all our Nation
-
-   Kin. Hee mad confession of you,
-And gaue you such a Masterly report,
-For Art and exercise in your defence;
-And for your Rapier most especiall,
-That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed,
-If one could match you Sir. This report of his
-Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy,
-That he could nothing doe but wish and begge,
-Your sodaine comming ore to play with him;
-Now out of this
+Queen.
+I'll warrant you:
+Fear me not:--withdraw; I hear him coming.
 
-   Laer. Why out of this, my Lord?
-  Kin. Laertes was your Father deare to you?
-Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
-A face without a heart?
-  Laer. Why aske you this?
-  Kin. Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father,
-But that I know Loue is begun by Time:
-And that I see in passages of proofe,
-Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it:
-Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake,
-To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed,
-More then in words?
-  Laer. To cut his throat i'th' Church
-
-   Kin. No place indeed should murder Sancturize;
-Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes
-Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber,
-Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home:
-Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence,
-And set a double varnish on the fame
-The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together,
-And wager on your heads, he being remisse,
-Most generous, and free from all contriuing,
-Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease,
-Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
-A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice,
-Requit him for your Father
+[Polonius goes behind the arras.]
 
-   Laer. I will doo't.
-And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword:
-I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
-So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it,
-Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare,
-Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
-Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death,
-That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point,
-With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,
-It may be death
-
-   Kin. Let's further thinke of this,
-Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes
-May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile;
-And that our drift looke through our bad performance,
-'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect
-Should haue a backe or second, that might hold,
-If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see
-Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings,
-I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry,
-As make your bowts more violent to the end,
-And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him
-A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
-If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
-Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene.
-Enter Queene.
+[Enter Hamlet.]
 
-  Queen. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele,
-So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes
+Ham.
+Now, mother, what's the matter?
 
-   Laer. Drown'd! O where?
-  Queen. There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke,
-That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame:
-There with fantasticke Garlands did she come,
-Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples,
-That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name;
-But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them:
-There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds
-Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke,
-When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe,
-Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide,
-And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp,
-Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,
-As one incapable of her owne distresse,
-Or like a creature Natiue, and indued
-Vnto that Element: but long it could not be,
-Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke,
-Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy,
-To muddy death
-
-   Laer. Alas then, is she drown'd?
-  Queen. Drown'd, drown'd
-
-   Laer. Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia,
-And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet
-It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds,
-Let shame say what it will; when these are gone
-The woman will be out: Adue my Lord,
-I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze,
-But that this folly doubts it.
-Enter.
-
-  Kin. Let's follow, Gertrude:
-How much I had to doe to calme his rage?
-Now feare I this will giue it start againe;
-Therefore let's follow.
+Queen.
+Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
 
-Exeunt.
+Ham.
+Mother, you have my father much offended.
 
-Enter two Clownes.
+Queen.
+Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
 
-  Clown. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that
-wilfully seekes her owne saluation?
-  Other. I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue
-straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian
-buriall
-
-   Clo. How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in
-her owne defence?
-  Other. Why 'tis found so
-
-   Clo. It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for
-heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues
-an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an
-Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe
-wittingly
-
-   Other. Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer
-
-   Clown. Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good:
-heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water
-and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes;
-marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne
-him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not
-guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life
-
-   Other. But is this law?
-  Clo. I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law
-
-   Other. Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not
-beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried
-out of Christian Buriall
-
-   Clo. Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that
-great folke should haue countenance in this world to
-drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian.
-Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen,
-but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp
-Adams Profession
-
-   Other. Was he a Gentleman?
-  Clo. He was the first that euer bore Armes
-
-   Other. Why he had none
-
-   Clo. What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand
-the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd;
-could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question
-to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse
-thy selfe-
-  Other. Go too
-
-   Clo. What is he that builds stronger then either the
-Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter?
-  Other. The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a
-thousand Tenants
-
-   Clo. I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes
-does well; but how does it well? it does well to those
-that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is
-built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes
-may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come
-
-   Other. Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright,
-or a Carpenter?
-  Clo. I, tell me that, and vnyoake
-
-   Other. Marry, now I can tell
-
-   Clo. Too't
-
-   Other. Masse, I cannot tell.
-Enter Hamlet and Horatio a farre off.
-
-  Clo. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your
-dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when
-you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the
-Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee
-to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor.
-
-Sings.
-
-In youth when I did loue, did loue,
-me thought it was very sweete:
-To contract O the time for a my behoue,
-O me thought there was nothing meete
-
-   Ham. Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that
-he sings at Graue-making?
-  Hor. Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse
-
-   Ham. 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath
-the daintier sense
-
-   Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps
-hath caught me in his clutch:
-And hath shipped me intill the Land,
-as if I had neuer beene such
-
-   Ham. That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing
-once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it
-were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It
-might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices:
-one that could circumuent God, might it not?
-  Hor. It might, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow
-sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this
-might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such
-a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not?
-  Hor. I, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes,
-Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons
-Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to
-see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but
-to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke
-on't
-
-   Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade,
-for and a shrowding-Sheete:
-O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
-for such a Guest is meete
-
-   Ham. There's another: why might not that bee the
-Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his
-Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why
-doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about
-the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of
-his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's
-time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances,
-his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries:
-Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries,
-to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his
-Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double
-ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of
-Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will
-hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe
-haue no more? ha?
-  Hor. Not a iot more, my Lord
-
-   Ham. Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes?
-  Hor. I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too
-
-   Ham. They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance
-in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's
-this Sir?
-  Clo. Mine Sir:
-O a Pit of Clay for to be made,
-for such a Guest is meete
-
-   Ham. I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't
-
-   Clo. You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours:
-for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine
-
-   Ham. Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine:
-'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou
-lyest
-
-   Clo. 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me
-to you
-
-   Ham. What man dost thou digge it for?
-  Clo. For no man Sir
-
-   Ham. What woman then?
-  Clo. For none neither
-
-   Ham. Who is to be buried in't?
-  Clo. One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule,
-shee's dead
-
-   Ham. How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake
-by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the
-Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it,
-the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant
-comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his
-Kibe. How long hast thou been a Graue-maker?
-  Clo. Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day
-that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras
-
-   Ham. How long is that since?
-  Clo. Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that:
-It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee
-that was mad, and sent into England
-
-   Ham. I marry, why was he sent into England?
-  Clo. Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his
-wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there
-
-   Ham. Why?
-  Clo. 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as
-mad as he
-
-   Ham. How came he mad?
-  Clo. Very strangely they say
-
-   Ham. How strangely?
-  Clo. Faith e'ene with loosing his wits
-
-   Ham. Vpon what ground?
-  Clo. Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene
-heere, man and Boy thirty yeares
-
-   Ham. How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot?
-  Clo. Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue
-many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold
-the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine
-yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare
-
-   Ham. Why he, more then another?
-  Clo. Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that
-he will keepe out water a great while. And your water,
-is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull
-now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years
-
-   Ham. Whose was it?
-  Clo. A whoreson mad Fellowes it was;
-Whose doe you thinke it was?
-  Ham. Nay, I know not
-
-   Clo. A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a
-Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull
-Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester
-
-   Ham. This?
-  Clo. E'ene that
-
-   Ham. Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio,
-a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he
-hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how
-abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere
-hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft.
-Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your
-Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to
-set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own
-Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies
-Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this
-fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee
-Horatio tell me one thing
-
-   Hor. What's that my Lord?
-  Ham. Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion
-i'th' earth?
-  Hor. E'ene so
-
-   Ham. And smelt so? Puh
-
-   Hor. E'ene so, my Lord
-
-   Ham. To what base vses we may returne Horatio.
-Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander,
-till he find it stopping a bunghole
-
-   Hor. 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so
-
-   Ham. No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether
-with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus.
-Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth
-into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make
-Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted)
-might they not stopp a Beere-barrell?
-Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
-Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away.
-Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
-Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw.
-But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King.
-Enter King, Queene, Laertes, and a Coffin, with Lords attendant.
-
-The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow,
-And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken,
-The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand,
-Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate.
-Couch we a while, and mark
-
-   Laer. What Cerimony else?
-  Ham. That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke
-
-   Laer. What Cerimony else?
-  Priest. Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd.
-As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull,
-And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order,
-She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd,
-Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier,
-Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her:
-Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites,
-Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home
-Of Bell and Buriall
-
-   Laer. Must there no more be done ?
-  Priest. No more be done:
-We should prophane the seruice of the dead,
-To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her
-As to peace-parted Soules
-
-   Laer. Lay her i'th' earth,
-And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh,
-May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest)
-A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be,
-When thou liest howling?
-  Ham. What, the faire Ophelia?
-  Queene. Sweets, to the sweet farewell.
-I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife:
-I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid)
-And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue
-
-   Laer. Oh terrible woer,
-Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head
-Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence
-Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,
-Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes:
-
-Leaps in the graue.
-
-Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead,
-Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made,
-To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head
-Of blew Olympus
-
-   Ham. What is he, whose griefes
-Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow
-Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand
-Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
-Hamlet the Dane
-
-   Laer. The deuill take thy soule
-
-   Ham. Thou prai'st not well,
-I prythee take thy fingers from my throat;
-Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash,
-Yet haue I something in me dangerous,
-Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand
-
-   King. Pluck them asunder
-
-   Qu. Hamlet, Hamlet
-
-   Gen. Good my Lord be quiet
-
-   Ham. Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme.
-Vntill my eielids will no longer wag
-
-   Qu. Oh my Sonne, what Theame?
-  Ham. I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers
-Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue)
-Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her?
-  King. Oh he is mad Laertes,
-  Qu. For loue of God forbeare him
-
-   Ham. Come show me what thou'lt doe.
-Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe?
-Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile?
-Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine;
-To outface me with leaping in her Graue?
-Be buried quicke with her, and so will I.
-And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw
-Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground
-Sindging his pate against the burning Zone,
-Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth,
-Ile rant as well as thou
-
-   Kin. This is meere Madnesse:
-And thus awhile the fit will worke on him:
-Anon as patient as the female Doue,
-When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd;
-His silence will sit drooping
-
-   Ham. Heare you Sir:
-What is the reason that you vse me thus?
-I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter:
-Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may,
-The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day.
-Enter.
-
-  Kin. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him,
-Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech,
-Wee'l put the matter to the present push:
-Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne,
-This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument:
-An houre of quiet shortly shall we see;
-Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
-
-Exeunt.
-
-Enter Hamlet and Horatio
-
-   Ham. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other,
-You doe remember all the Circumstance
-
-   Hor. Remember it my Lord?
-  Ham. Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting,
-That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay
-Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly,
-(And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know,
-Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well,
-When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs,
-There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends,
-Rough-hew them how we will
-
-   Hor. That is most certaine
-
-   Ham. Vp from my Cabin
-My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke,
-Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire,
-Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew
-To mine owne roome againe, making so bold,
-(My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale
-Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio,
-Oh royall knauery: An exact command,
-Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason;
-Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too,
-With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life,
-That on the superuize no leasure bated,
-No not to stay the grinding of the Axe,
-My head should be struck off
-
-   Hor. Ist possible?
-  Ham. Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure:
-But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed?
-  Hor. I beseech you
-
-   Ham. Being thus benetted round with Villaines,
-Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines,
-They had begun the Play. I sate me downe,
-Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire,
-I once did hold it as our Statists doe,
-A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much
-How to forget that learning: but Sir now,
-It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know
-The effects of what I wrote?
-  Hor. I, good my Lord
-
-   Ham. An earnest Coniuration from the King,
-As England was his faithfull Tributary,
-As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish,
-As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare,
-And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities,
-And many such like Assis of great charge,
-That on the view and know of these Contents,
-Without debatement further, more or lesse,
-He should the bearers put to sodaine death,
-Not shriuing time allowed
-
-   Hor. How was this seal'd?
-  Ham. Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate;
-I had my fathers Signet in my Purse,
-Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale:
-Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other,
-Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely,
-The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day
-Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement,
-Thou know'st already
-
-   Hor. So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't
-
-   Ham. Why man, they did make loue to this imployment
-They are not neere my Conscience; their debate
-Doth by their owne insinuation grow:
-'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes
-Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points
-Of mighty opposites
-
-   Hor. Why, what a King is this?
-  Ham. Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon
-He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother,
-Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes,
-Throwne out his Angle for my proper life,
-And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience,
-To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd
-To let this Canker of our nature come
-In further euill
-
-   Hor. It must be shortly knowne to him from England
-What is the issue of the businesse there
-
-   Ham. It will be short,
-The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more
-Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio,
-That to Laertes I forgot my selfe;
-For by the image of my Cause, I see
-The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours:
-But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me
-Into a Towring passion
-
-   Hor. Peace, who comes heere?
-Enter young Osricke.
-
-  Osr. Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke
-
-   Ham. I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie?
-  Hor. No my good Lord
-
-   Ham. Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
-know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast
-be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings
-Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession
-of dirt
-
-   Osr. Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure,
-I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty
-
-   Ham. I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put
-your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head
-
-   Osr. I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot
-
-   Ham. No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is
-Northerly
-
-   Osr. It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed
-
-   Ham. Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my
-Complexion
-
-   Osr. Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere
-I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie
-to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head:
-Sir, this is the matter
-
-   Ham. I beseech you remember
-
-   Osr. Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith:
-Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at
-his weapon
-
-   Ham. What's his weapon?
-  Osr. Rapier and dagger
-
-   Ham. That's two of his weapons; but well
-
-   Osr. The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses,
-against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French
-Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle,
-Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very
-deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate
-carriages, and of very liberall conceit
-
-   Ham. What call you the Carriages?
-  Osr. The Carriages Sir, are the hangers
-
-   Ham. The phrase would bee more Germaine to the
-matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would
-it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses
-against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three
-liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against
-the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it?
-  Osr. The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene
-you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits;
-He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to
-imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the
-Answere
-
-   Ham. How if I answere no?
-  Osr. I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person
-in tryall
-
-   Ham. Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please
-his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
-the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the
-King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if
-not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits
-
-   Osr. Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so?
-  Ham. To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature
-will
-
-   Osr. I commend my duty to your Lordship
-
-   Ham. Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it
-himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue
-
-   Hor. This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his
-head
-
-   Ham. He did Complie with his Dugge before hee
-suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty
-that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of
-the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of
-yesty collection, which carries them through & through
-the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow
-them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out
-
-   Hor. You will lose this wager, my Lord
-
-   Ham. I doe not thinke so, since he went into France,
-I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the
-oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about
-my heart: but it is no matter
-
-   Hor. Nay, good my Lord
-
-   Ham. It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of
-gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman
-
-   Hor. If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall
-their repaire hither, and say you are not fit
-
-   Ham. Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall
-Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not
-to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it
-be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no
-man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes?
-Enter King, Queene, Laertes and Lords, with other Attendants with
-Foyles,
-and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it.
-
-  Kin. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me
-
-   Ham. Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong,
-But pardon't as you are a Gentleman.
-This presence knowes,
-And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht
-With sore distraction? What I haue done
-That might your nature honour, and exception
-Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse:
-Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet.
-If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away:
-And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes,
-Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it:
-Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so,
-Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd,
-His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy.
-Sir, in this Audience,
-Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill,
-Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts,
-That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,
-And hurt my Mother
-
-   Laer. I am satisfied in Nature,
-Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most
-To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor
-I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement,
-Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor,
-I haue a voyce, and president of peace
-To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time,
-I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue,
-And wil not wrong it
-
-   Ham. I do embrace it freely,
-And will this Brothers wager frankely play.
-Giue vs the Foyles: Come on
-
-   Laer. Come one for me
-
-   Ham. Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance,
-Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night,
-Sticke fiery off indeede
-
-   Laer. You mocke me Sir
-
-   Ham. No by this hand
-
-   King. Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke,
-Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager
-
-   Ham. Verie well my Lord,
-Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side
-
-   King. I do not feare it,
-I haue seene you both:
-But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes
-
-   Laer. This is too heauy,
-Let me see another
-
-   Ham. This likes me well,
-These Foyles haue all a length.
+Ham.
+Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
 
-Prepare to play.
+Queen.
+Why, how now, Hamlet!
 
-  Osricke. I my good Lord
+Ham.
+What's the matter now?
 
-   King. Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table:
-If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit,
-Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
-Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire,
-The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath,
-And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw
-Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings
-In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne.
-Giue me the Cups,
-And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake,
-The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without,
-The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth,
-Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin,
-And you the Iudges beare a wary eye
+Queen.
+Have you forgot me?
 
-   Ham. Come on sir
+Ham.
+No, by the rood, not so:
+You are the Queen, your husband's brother's wife,
+And,--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
 
-   Laer. Come on sir.
+Queen.
+Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
 
-They play.
+Ham.
+Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
+You go not till I set you up a glass
+Where you may see the inmost part of you.
 
-  Ham. One
+Queen.
+What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?--
+Help, help, ho!
 
-   Laer. No
+Pol.
+[Behind.] What, ho! help, help, help!
 
-   Ham. Iudgement
+Ham.
+How now? a rat? [Draws.]
+Dead for a ducat, dead!
 
-   Osr. A hit, a very palpable hit
+[Makes a pass through the arras.]
 
-   Laer. Well: againe
+Pol.
+[Behind.] O, I am slain!
 
-   King. Stay, giue me drinke.
-Hamlet, this Pearle is thine,
-Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup,
+[Falls and dies.]
 
-Trumpets sound, and shot goes off.
+Queen.
+O me, what hast thou done?
 
-  Ham. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while.
-Come: Another hit; what say you?
-  Laer. A touch, a touch, I do confesse
+Ham.
+Nay, I know not: is it the king?
 
-   King. Our Sonne shall win
+[Draws forth Polonius.]
 
-   Qu. He's fat, and scant of breath.
-Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes,
-The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet
+Queen.
+O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
 
-   Ham. Good Madam
+Ham.
+A bloody deed!--almost as bad, good mother,
+As kill a king and marry with his brother.
 
-   King. Gertrude, do not drinke
+Queen.
+As kill a king!
 
-   Qu. I will my Lord;
-I pray you pardon me
+Ham.
+Ay, lady, 'twas my word.--
+Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
+[To Polonius.]
+I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
+Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.--
+Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
+And let me wring your heart: for so I shall,
+If it be made of penetrable stuff;
+If damned custom have not braz'd it so
+That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
 
-   King. It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late
+Queen.
+What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue
+In noise so rude against me?
 
-   Ham. I dare not drinke yet Madam,
-By and by
+Ham.
+Such an act
+That blurs the grace and blush of modesty;
+Calls virtue hypocrite; takes off the rose
+From the fair forehead of an innocent love,
+And sets a blister there; makes marriage-vows
+As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
+As from the body of contraction plucks
+The very soul, and sweet religion makes
+A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow;
+Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
+With tristful visage, as against the doom,
+Is thought-sick at the act.
+
+Queen.
+Ah me, what act,
+That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
+
+Ham.
+Look here upon this picture, and on this,--
+The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
+See what a grace was seated on this brow;
+Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
+An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
+A station like the herald Mercury
+New lighted on a heaven-kissing hill:
+A combination and a form, indeed,
+Where every god did seem to set his seal,
+To give the world assurance of a man;
+This was your husband.--Look you now what follows:
+Here is your husband, like a milldew'd ear
+Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
+Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
+And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
+You cannot call it love; for at your age
+The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
+And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
+Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
+Else could you not have motion: but sure that sense
+Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err;
+Nor sense to ecstacy was ne'er so thrall'd
+But it reserv'd some quantity of choice
+To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
+That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
+Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
+Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
+Or but a sickly part of one true sense
+Could not so mope.
+O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
+If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
+To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
+And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
+When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
+Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
+And reason panders will.
+
+Queen.
+O Hamlet, speak no more:
+Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
+And there I see such black and grained spots
+As will not leave their tinct.
+
+Ham.
+Nay, but to live
+In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
+Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
+Over the nasty sty,--
+
+Queen.
+O, speak to me no more;
+These words like daggers enter in mine ears;
+No more, sweet Hamlet.
+
+Ham.
+A murderer and a villain;
+A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
+Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
+A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
+That from a shelf the precious diadem stole
+And put it in his pocket!
+
+Queen.
+No more.
+
+Ham.
+A king of shreds and patches!--
+
+[Enter Ghost.]
+
+Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
+You heavenly guards!--What would your gracious figure?
+
+Queen.
+Alas, he's mad!
+
+Ham.
+Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
+That, laps'd in time and passion, lets go by
+The important acting of your dread command?
+O, say!
 
-   Qu. Come, let me wipe thy face
+Ghost.
+Do not forget. This visitation
+Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
+But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
+O, step between her and her fighting soul,--
+Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works,--
+Speak to her, Hamlet.
+
+Ham.
+How is it with you, lady?
+
+Queen.
+Alas, how is't with you,
+That you do bend your eye on vacancy,
+And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
+Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
+And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
+Your bedded hairs, like life in excrements,
+Start up and stand an end. O gentle son,
+Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
+Sprinkle cool patience! Whereon do you look?
+
+Ham.
+On him, on him! Look you how pale he glares!
+His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
+Would make them capable.--Do not look upon me;
+Lest with this piteous action you convert
+My stern effects: then what I have to do
+Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
+
+Queen.
+To whom do you speak this?
+
+Ham.
+Do you see nothing there?
+
+Queen.
+Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
+
+Ham.
+Nor did you nothing hear?
+
+Queen.
+No, nothing but ourselves.
+
+Ham.
+Why, look you there! look how it steals away!
+My father, in his habit as he liv'd!
+Look, where he goes, even now out at the portal!
+
+[Exit Ghost.]
+
+Queen.
+This is the very coinage of your brain:
+This bodiless creation ecstasy
+Is very cunning in.
+
+Ham.
+Ecstasy!
+My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
+And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
+That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
+And I the matter will re-word; which madness
+Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
+Lay not that flattering unction to your soul
+That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
+It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
+Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
+Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
+Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
+And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
+To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
+For in the fatness of these pursy times
+Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
+Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
+
+Queen.
+O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
+
+Ham.
+O, throw away the worser part of it,
+And live the purer with the other half.
+Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
+Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
+That monster custom, who all sense doth eat,
+Of habits evil, is angel yet in this,--
+That to the use of actions fair and good
+He likewise gives a frock or livery
+That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night;
+And that shall lend a kind of easiness
+To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
+For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
+And either curb the devil, or throw him out
+With wondrous potency. Once more, good-night:
+And when you are desirous to be bles'd,
+I'll blessing beg of you.--For this same lord
+[Pointing to Polonius.]
+I do repent; but heaven hath pleas'd it so,
+To punish me with this, and this with me,
+That I must be their scourge and minister.
+I will bestow him, and will answer well
+The death I gave him. So again, good-night.--
+I must be cruel, only to be kind:
+Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.--
+One word more, good lady.
+
+Queen.
+What shall I do?
+
+Ham.
+Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
+Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
+Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
+And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
+Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
+Make you to ravel all this matter out,
+That I essentially am not in madness,
+But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
+For who that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
+Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
+Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
+No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
+Unpeg the basket on the house's top,
+Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
+To try conclusions, in the basket creep
+And break your own neck down.
+
+Queen.
+Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath,
+And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
+What thou hast said to me.
+
+Ham.
+I must to England; you know that?
+
+Queen.
+Alack,
+I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
+
+Ham.
+There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,--
+Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,--
+They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way
+And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
+For 'tis the sport to have the enginer
+Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
+But I will delve one yard below their mines
+And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
+When in one line two crafts directly meet.--
+This man shall set me packing:
+I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.--
+Mother, good-night.--Indeed, this counsellor
+Is now most still, most secret, and most grave,
+Who was in life a foolish peating knave.
+Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you:--
+Good night, mother.
+
+[Exeunt severally; Hamlet, dragging out Polonius.]
+
+
+
+ACT IV.
+
+Scene I. A room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter King, Queen, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+King.
+There's matter in these sighs. These profound heaves
+You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
+Where is your son?
+
+Queen.
+Bestow this place on us a little while.
+
+[To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who go out.]
+
+Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
+
+King.
+What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
+
+Queen.
+Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
+Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit
+Behind the arras hearing something stir,
+Whips out his rapier, cries 'A rat, a rat!'
+And in this brainish apprehension, kills
+The unseen good old man.
+
+King.
+O heavy deed!
+It had been so with us, had we been there:
+His liberty is full of threats to all;
+To you yourself, to us, to every one.
+Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
+It will be laid to us, whose providence
+Should have kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt
+This mad young man. But so much was our love
+We would not understand what was most fit;
+But, like the owner of a foul disease,
+To keep it from divulging, let it feed
+Even on the pith of life. Where is he gone?
+
+Queen.
+To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
+O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
+Among a mineral of metals base,
+Shows itself pure: he weeps for what is done.
+
+King.
+O Gertrude, come away!
+The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch
+But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
+We must with all our majesty and skill
+Both countenance and excuse.--Ho, Guildenstern!
+
+[Re-enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
+Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
+And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
+Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
+Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
+
+[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
+And let them know both what we mean to do
+And what's untimely done: so haply slander,--
+Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
+As level as the cannon to his blank,
+Transports his poison'd shot,--may miss our name,
+And hit the woundless air.--O, come away!
+My soul is full of discord and dismay.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+Scene II. Another room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter Hamlet.]
+
+Ham.
+Safely stowed.
+
+Ros. and Guil.
+[Within.] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!
+
+Ham.
+What noise? who calls on Hamlet? O, here they come.
+
+[Enter Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+Ros.
+What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
+
+Ham.
+Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
+
+Ros.
+Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence,
+And bear it to the chapel.
+
+Ham.
+Do not believe it.
+
+Ros.
+Believe what?
+
+Ham.
+That I can keep your counsel, and not mine own. Besides, to be
+demanded of a sponge!--what replication should be made by the son
+of a king?
+
+Ros.
+Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Ay, sir; that soaks up the King's countenance, his rewards,
+his authorities. But such officers do the king best service in
+the end: he keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw;
+first mouthed, to be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
+gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you shall be dry
+again.
+
+Ros.
+I understand you not, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
+
+Ros.
+My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us to
+the king.
+
+Ham.
+The body is with the king, but the king is not with the body.
+The king is a thing,--
+
+Guil.
+A thing, my lord!
+
+Ham.
+Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene III. Another room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter King,attended.]
+
+King.
+I have sent to seek him and to find the body.
+How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
+Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
+He's lov'd of the distracted multitude,
+Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
+And where 'tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
+But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
+This sudden sending him away must seem
+Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
+By desperate appliance are reliev'd,
+Or not at all.
+
+[Enter Rosencrantz.]
+
+How now! what hath befall'n?
 
-   Laer. My Lord, Ile hit him now
+Ros.
+Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
+We cannot get from him.
+
+King.
+But where is he?
+
+Ros.
+Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
+
+King.
+Bring him before us.
+
+Ros.
+Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
+
+[Enter Hamlet and Guildenstern.]
+
+King.
+Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
+
+Ham.
+At supper.
+
+King.
+At supper! where?
+
+Ham.
+Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
+convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your
+only emperor for diet: we fat all creatures else to fat us, and
+we fat ourselves for maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar
+is but variable service,--two dishes, but to one table: that's
+the end.
+
+King.
+Alas, alas!
+
+Ham.
+A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat
+of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
+
+King.
+What dost thou mean by this?
+
+Ham.
+Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through
+the guts of a beggar.
+
+King.
+Where is Polonius?
+
+Ham.
+In heaven: send thither to see: if your messenger find him not
+there, seek him i' the other place yourself. But, indeed, if you
+find him not within this month, you shall nose him as you go up
+the stairs into the lobby.
+
+King.
+Go seek him there. [To some Attendants.]
+
+Ham.
+He will stay till you come.
+
+[Exeunt Attendants.]
+
+King.
+Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
+Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
+For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
+With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
+The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
+The associates tend, and everything is bent
+For England.
+
+Ham.
+For England!
+
+King.
+Ay, Hamlet.
+
+Ham.
+Good.
+
+King.
+So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
+
+Ham.
+I see a cherub that sees them.--But, come; for England!--
+Farewell, dear mother.
+
+King.
+Thy loving father, Hamlet.
+
+Ham.
+My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man and wife is
+one flesh; and so, my mother.--Come, for England!
+
+[Exit.]
+
+King.
+Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
+Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
+Away! for everything is seal'd and done
+That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
+
+[Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.]
+
+And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught,--
+As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
+Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
+After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
+Pays homage to us,--thou mayst not coldly set
+Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
+By letters conjuring to that effect,
+The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
+For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
+And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
+Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+
+
+Scene IV. A plain in Denmark.
+
+[Enter Fortinbras, and Forces marching.]
+
+For.
+Go, Captain, from me greet the Danish king:
+Tell him that, by his license, Fortinbras
+Craves the conveyance of a promis'd march
+Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
+If that his majesty would aught with us,
+We shall express our duty in his eye;
+And let him know so.
+
+Capt.
+I will do't, my lord.
+
+For.
+Go softly on.
+
+[Exeunt all For. and Forces.]
+
+[Enter Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, &c.]
+
+Ham.
+Good sir, whose powers are these?
+
+Capt.
+They are of Norway, sir.
+
+Ham.
+How purpos'd, sir, I pray you?
+
+Capt.
+Against some part of Poland.
+
+Ham.
+Who commands them, sir?
+
+Capt.
+The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
+
+Ham.
+Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
+Or for some frontier?
+
+Capt.
+Truly to speak, and with no addition,
+We go to gain a little patch of ground
+That hath in it no profit but the name.
+To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
+Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
+A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
+
+Ham.
+Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
+
+Capt.
+Yes, it is already garrison'd.
+
+Ham.
+Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
+Will not debate the question of this straw:
+This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
+That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
+Why the man dies.--I humbly thank you, sir.
+
+Capt.
+God b' wi' you, sir.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Ros.
+Will't please you go, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+I'll be with you straight. Go a little before.
+
+[Exeunt all but Hamlet.]
+
+How all occasions do inform against me
+And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
+If his chief good and market of his time
+Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
+Sure he that made us with such large discourse,
+Looking before and after, gave us not
+That capability and godlike reason
+To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
+Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
+Of thinking too precisely on the event,--
+A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
+And ever three parts coward,--I do not know
+Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
+Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means
+To do't. Examples, gross as earth, exhort me:
+Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
+Led by a delicate and tender prince;
+Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
+Makes mouths at the invisible event;
+Exposing what is mortal and unsure
+To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
+Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
+Is not to stir without great argument,
+But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
+When honour's at the stake. How stand I, then,
+That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
+Excitements of my reason and my blood,
+And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
+The imminent death of twenty thousand men
+That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
+Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot
+Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
+Which is not tomb enough and continent
+To hide the slain?--O, from this time forth,
+My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!
+
+[Exit.]
+
+
+
+Scene V. Elsinore. A room in the Castle.
+
+[Enter Queen and Horatio.]
+
+Queen.
+I will not speak with her.
+
+Gent.
+She is importunate; indeed distract:
+Her mood will needs be pitied.
+
+Queen.
+What would she have?
+
+Gent.
+She speaks much of her father; says she hears
+There's tricks i' the world, and hems, and beats her heart;
+Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
+That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
+Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
+The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
+And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
+Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures yield them,
+Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
+Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
+'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
+Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
+
+Queen.
+Let her come in.
+
+[Exit Horatio.]
+
+To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
+Each toy seems Prologue to some great amiss:
+So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
+It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
+
+[Re-enter Horatio with Ophelia.]
+
+Oph.
+Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
+
+Queen.
+How now, Ophelia?
+
+Oph. [Sings.]
+   How should I your true love know
+     From another one?
+   By his cockle bat and' staff
+     And his sandal shoon.
+
+Queen.
+Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
+
+Oph.
+Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
+[Sings.]
+   He is dead and gone, lady,
+     He is dead and gone;
+   At his head a grass green turf,
+     At his heels a stone.
+
+Queen.
+Nay, but Ophelia--
+
+Oph.
+Pray you, mark.
+[Sings.]
+   White his shroud as the mountain snow,
+
+[Enter King.]
+
+Queen.
+Alas, look here, my lord!
+
+Oph.
+[Sings.]
+     Larded all with sweet flowers;
+   Which bewept to the grave did go
+     With true-love showers.
+
+King.
+How do you, pretty lady?
+
+Oph.
+Well, God dild you! They say the owl was a baker's daughter.
+Lord, we know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at
+your table!
+
+King.
+Conceit upon her father.
+
+Oph.
+Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they ask you what
+it means, say you this:
+[Sings.]
+   To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day
+     All in the morning bedtime,
+   And I a maid at your window,
+     To be your Valentine.
+
+   Then up he rose and donn'd his clothes,
+     And dupp'd the chamber door,
+   Let in the maid, that out a maid
+     Never departed more.
+
+King.
+Pretty Ophelia!
+
+Oph.
+Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
+[Sings.]
+   By Gis and by Saint Charity,
+     Alack, and fie for shame!
+   Young men will do't if they come to't;
+     By cock, they are to blame.
+
+   Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
+     You promis'd me to wed.
+   So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
+     An thou hadst not come to my bed.
+
+King.
+How long hath she been thus?
+
+Oph.
+I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I cannot
+choose but weep, to think they would lay him i' the cold ground.
+My brother shall know of it: and so I thank you for your good
+counsel.--Come, my coach!--Good night, ladies; good night, sweet
+ladies; good night, good night.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+King.
+Follow her close; give her good watch, I pray you.
+
+[Exit Horatio.]
+
+O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
+All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
+When sorrows come, they come not single spies,
+But in battalions! First, her father slain:
+Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
+Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
+Thick and and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers
+For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly
+In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
+Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
+Without the which we are pictures or mere beasts:
+Last, and as much containing as all these,
+Her brother is in secret come from France;
+Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
+And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
+With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
+Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
+Will nothing stick our person to arraign
+In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
+Like to a murdering piece, in many places
+Give, me superfluous death.
+
+[A noise within.]
+
+Queen.
+Alack, what noise is this?
+
+King.
+Where are my Switzers? let them guard the door.
+
+[Enter a Gentleman.]
+
+What is the matter?
+
+Gent.
+Save yourself, my lord:
+The ocean, overpeering of his list,
+Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
+Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
+O'erbears your offices. The rabble call him lord;
+And, as the world were now but to begin,
+Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
+The ratifiers and props of every word,
+They cry 'Choose we! Laertes shall be king!'
+Caps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,
+'Laertes shall be king! Laertes king!'
+
+Queen.
+How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
+O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
+
+[A noise within.]
+
+King.
+The doors are broke.
+
+[Enter Laertes, armed; Danes following.]
+
+Laer.
+Where is this king?--Sirs, stand you all without.
+
+Danes.
+No, let's come in.
+
+Laer.
+I pray you, give me leave.
+
+Danes.
+We will, we will.
+
+[They retire without the door.]
+
+Laer.
+I thank you:--keep the door.--O thou vile king,
+Give me my father!
+
+Queen.
+Calmly, good Laertes.
+
+Laer.
+That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard;
+Cries cuckold to my father; brands the harlot
+Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
+Of my true mother.
+
+King.
+What is the cause, Laertes,
+That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?--
+Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
+There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
+That treason can but peep to what it would,
+Acts little of his will.--Tell me, Laertes,
+Why thou art thus incens'd.--Let him go, Gertrude:--
+Speak, man.
+
+Laer.
+Where is my father?
+
+King.
+Dead.
+
+Queen.
+But not by him.
+
+King.
+Let him demand his fill.
+
+Laer.
+How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
+To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
+Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
+I dare damnation:--to this point I stand,--
+That both the worlds, I give to negligence,
+Let come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd
+Most throughly for my father.
+
+King.
+Who shall stay you?
+
+Laer.
+My will, not all the world:
+And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
+They shall go far with little.
+
+King.
+Good Laertes,
+If you desire to know the certainty
+Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge
+That, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
+Winner and loser?
+
+Laer.
+None but his enemies.
+
+King.
+Will you know them then?
+
+Laer.
+To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
+And, like the kind life-rendering pelican,
+Repast them with my blood.
+
+King.
+Why, now you speak
+Like a good child and a true gentleman.
+That I am guiltless of your father's death,
+And am most sensibly in grief for it,
+It shall as level to your judgment pierce
+As day does to your eye.
+
+Danes.
+[Within] Let her come in.
+
+Laer.
+How now! What noise is that?
+
+[Re-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and
+flowers.]
+
+O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
+Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!--
+By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
+Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
+Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!--
+O heavens! is't possible a young maid's wits
+Should be as mortal as an old man's life?
+Nature is fine in love; and where 'tis fine,
+It sends some precious instance of itself
+After the thing it loves.
+
+Oph.
+[Sings.]
+   They bore him barefac'd on the bier
+   Hey no nonny, nonny, hey nonny
+   And on his grave rain'd many a tear.--
+
+Fare you well, my dove!
+
+Laer.
+Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
+It could not move thus.
+
+Oph.
+You must sing 'Down a-down, an you call him a-down-a.' O,
+how the wheel becomes it! It is the false steward, that stole his
+master's daughter.
+
+Laer.
+This nothing's more than matter.
+
+Oph.
+There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray, love,
+remember: and there is pansies, that's for thoughts.
+
+Laer.
+A document in madness,--thoughts and remembrance fitted.
+
+Oph.
+There's fennel for you, and columbines:--there's rue for you;
+and here's some for me:--we may call it herb of grace o'
+Sundays:--O, you must wear your rue with a difference.--There's a
+daisy:--I would give you some violets, but they wither'd all when
+my father died:--they say he made a good end,--
+[Sings.]
+   For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy,--
+
+Laer.
+Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
+She turns to favour and to prettiness.
+
+Oph.
+[Sings.]
+   And will he not come again?
+   And will he not come again?
+     No, no, he is dead,
+     Go to thy death-bed,
+   He never will come again.
+
+   His beard was as white as snow,
+   All flaxen was his poll:
+     He is gone, he is gone,
+     And we cast away moan:
+   God ha' mercy on his soul!
+
+And of all Christian souls, I pray God.--God b' wi' ye.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+Laer.
+Do you see this, O God?
+
+King.
+Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
+Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
+Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will,
+And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.
+If by direct or by collateral hand
+They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
+Our crown, our life, and all that we call ours,
+To you in satisfaction; but if not,
+Be you content to lend your patience to us,
+And we shall jointly labour with your soul
+To give it due content.
+
+Laer.
+Let this be so;
+His means of death, his obscure burial,--
+No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
+No noble rite nor formal ostentation,--
+Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
+That I must call't in question.
+
+King.
+So you shall;
+And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
+I pray you go with me.
+
+[Exeunt.]
 
-   King. I do not thinke't
 
-   Laer. And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience
 
-   Ham. Come for the third.
-Laertes, you but dally,
-I pray you passe with your best violence,
-I am affear'd you make a wanton of me
+Scene VI. Another room in the Castle.
 
-   Laer. Say you so? Come on.
+[Enter Horatio and a Servant.]
 
-Play.
+Hor.
+What are they that would speak with me?
 
-  Osr. Nothing neither way
+Servant.
+Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.
 
-   Laer. Haue at you now.
+Hor.
+Let them come in.
 
-In scuffling they change Rapiers.
+[Exit Servant.]
 
-  King. Part them, they are incens'd
+I do not know from what part of the world
+I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.
 
-   Ham. Nay come, againe
+[Enter Sailors.]
 
-   Osr. Looke to the Queene there hoa
+I Sailor.
+God bless you, sir.
 
-   Hor. They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord?
-  Osr. How is't Laertes?
-  Laer. Why as a Woodcocke
-To mine Sprindge, Osricke,
-I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie
+Hor.
+Let him bless thee too.
 
-   Ham. How does the Queene?
-  King. She sounds to see them bleede
+Sailor.
+He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for you,
+sir,--it comes from the ambassador that was bound for England; if
+your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is.
+
+Hor.
+[Reads.] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
+this, give these fellows some means to the king: they have
+letters for him. Ere we were two days old at sea, a pirate of
+very warlike appointment gave us chase. Finding ourselves too
+slow of sail, we put on a compelled valour, and in the grapple I
+boarded them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so I
+alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with me like thieves
+of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for
+them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou
+to me with as much haste as thou wouldst fly death. I have words
+to speak in thine ear will make thee dumb; yet are they much too
+light for the bore of the matter. These good fellows will bring
+thee where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their course
+for England: of them I have much to tell thee. Farewell.
+He that thou knowest thine,       HAMLET.'
 
-   Qu. No, no, the drinke, the drinke.
-Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke,
-I am poyson'd
+Come, I will give you way for these your letters;
+And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
+To him from whom you brought them.
 
-   Ham. Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd.
-Treacherie, seeke it out
+[Exeunt.]
 
-   Laer. It is heere Hamlet.
-Hamlet, thou art slaine,
-No Medicine in the world can do thee good.
-In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life;
-The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand,
-Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise
-Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye,
-Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd:
-I can no more, the King, the King's too blame
 
-   Ham. The point envenom'd too,
-Then venome to thy worke.
 
-Hurts the King.
+Scene VII. Another room in the Castle.
 
-  All. Treason, Treason
+[Enter King and Laertes.]
 
-   King. O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt
+King.
+Now must your conscience my acquittance seal,
+And you must put me in your heart for friend,
+Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
+That he which hath your noble father slain
+Pursu'd my life.
+
+Laer.
+It well appears:--but tell me
+Why you proceeded not against these feats,
+So crimeful and so capital in nature,
+As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
+You mainly were stirr'd up.
+
+King.
+O, for two special reasons;
+Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
+But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
+Lives almost by his looks; and for myself,--
+My virtue or my plague, be it either which,--
+She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
+That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
+I could not but by her. The other motive,
+Why to a public count I might not go,
+Is the great love the general gender bear him;
+Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
+Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
+Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
+Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
+Would have reverted to my bow again,
+And not where I had aim'd them.
+
+Laer.
+And so have I a noble father lost;
+A sister driven into desperate terms,--
+Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
+Stood challenger on mount of all the age
+For her perfections:--but my revenge will come.
+
+King.
+Break not your sleeps for that:--you must not think
+That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
+That we can let our beard be shook with danger,
+And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
+I lov'd your father, and we love ourself;
+And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine,--
+
+[Enter a Messenger.]
+
+How now! What news?
+
+Mess.
+Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
+This to your majesty; this to the queen.
+
+King.
+From Hamlet! Who brought them?
+
+Mess.
+Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
+They were given me by Claudio:--he receiv'd them
+Of him that brought them.
+
+King.
+Laertes, you shall hear them.
+Leave us.
+
+[Exit Messenger.]
+
+[Reads]'High and mighty,--You shall know I am set naked on your
+kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes:
+when I shall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the
+occasions of my sudden and more strange return.       HAMLET.'
+
+What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
+Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
+
+Laer.
+Know you the hand?
+
+King.
+'Tis Hamlet's character:--'Naked!'--
+And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
+Can you advise me?
+
+Laer.
+I am lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
+It warms the very sickness in my heart
+That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
+'Thus didest thou.'
+
+King.
+If it be so, Laertes,--
+As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
+Will you be rul'd by me?
+
+Laer.
+Ay, my lord;
+So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
+
+King.
+To thine own peace. If he be now return'd--
+As checking at his voyage, and that he means
+No more to undertake it,--I will work him
+To exploit, now ripe in my device,
+Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
+And for his death no wind shall breathe;
+But even his mother shall uncharge the practice
+And call it accident.
+
+Laer.
+My lord, I will be rul'd;
+The rather if you could devise it so
+That I might be the organ.
+
+King.
+It falls right.
+You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
+And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
+Wherein they say you shine: your sum of parts
+Did not together pluck such envy from him
+As did that one; and that, in my regard,
+Of the unworthiest siege.
+
+Laer.
+What part is that, my lord?
+
+King.
+A very riband in the cap of youth,
+Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
+The light and careless livery that it wears
+Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
+Importing health and graveness.--Two months since,
+Here was a gentleman of Normandy,--
+I've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,
+And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
+Had witchcraft in't: he grew unto his seat;
+And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
+As had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd
+With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought
+That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
+Come short of what he did.
+
+Laer.
+A Norman was't?
+
+King.
+A Norman.
+
+Laer.
+Upon my life, Lamond.
+
+King.
+The very same.
+
+Laer.
+I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
+And gem of all the nation.
+
+King.
+He made confession of you;
+And gave you such a masterly report
+For art and exercise in your defence,
+And for your rapier most especially,
+That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed
+If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation
+He swore, had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
+If you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his
+Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
+That he could nothing do but wish and beg
+Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
+Now, out of this,--
 
-   Ham. Heere thou incestuous, murdrous,
-Damned Dane,
-Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere?
-Follow my Mother.
+Laer.
+What out of this, my lord?
 
-King Dyes.
+King.
+Laertes, was your father dear to you?
+Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
+A face without a heart?
 
-  Laer. He is iustly seru'd.
-It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe:
-Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet;
-Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee,
-Nor thine on me.
+Laer.
+Why ask you this?
 
-Dyes.
+King.
+Not that I think you did not love your father;
+But that I know love is begun by time,
+And that I see, in passages of proof,
+Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
+There lives within the very flame of love
+A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
+And nothing is at a like goodness still;
+For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
+Dies in his own too much: that we would do,
+We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,
+And hath abatements and delays as many
+As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
+And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
+That hurts by easing. But to the quick o' the ulcer:--
+Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake
+To show yourself your father's son in deed
+More than in words?
+
+Laer.
+To cut his throat i' the church.
+
+King.
+No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
+Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
+Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
+Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
+We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
+And set a double varnish on the fame
+The Frenchman gave you; bring you in fine together
+And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
+Most generous, and free from all contriving,
+Will not peruse the foils; so that with ease,
+Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
+A sword unbated, and, in a pass of practice,
+Requite him for your father.
 
-  Ham. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee.
-I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew,
-You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance,
-That are but Mutes or audience to this acte:
-Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death
-Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you.
-But let it be: Horatio, I am dead,
-Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right
-To the vnsatisfied
+Laer.
+I will do't:
+And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.
+I bought an unction of a mountebank,
+So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
+Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
+Collected from all simples that have virtue
+Under the moon, can save the thing from death
+This is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
+With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
+It may be death.
+
+King.
+Let's further think of this;
+Weigh what convenience both of time and means
+May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
+And that our drift look through our bad performance.
+'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
+Should have a back or second, that might hold
+If this did blast in proof. Soft! let me see:--
+We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,--
+I ha't:
+When in your motion you are hot and dry,--
+As make your bouts more violent to that end,--
+And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him
+A chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,
+If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
+Our purpose may hold there.
 
-   Hor. Neuer beleeue it.
-I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane:
-Heere's yet some Liquor left
+[Enter Queen.]
 
-   Ham. As th'art a man, giue me the Cup.
-Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't.
-Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name,
-(Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me.
-If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart,
-Absent thee from felicitie awhile,
-And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine,
-To tell my Storie.
+How now, sweet queen!
 
-March afarre off, and shout within.
+Queen.
+One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
+So fast they follow:--your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
+
+Laer.
+Drown'd! O, where?
+
+Queen.
+There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
+That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
+There with fantastic garlands did she come
+Of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,
+That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
+But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
+There, on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds
+Clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke;
+When down her weedy trophies and herself
+Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
+And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up;
+Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes;
+As one incapable of her own distress,
+Or like a creature native and indu'd
+Unto that element: but long it could not be
+Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
+Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
+To muddy death.
+
+Laer.
+Alas, then she is drown'd?
+
+Queen.
+Drown'd, drown'd.
+
+Laer.
+Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
+And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
+It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
+Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
+The woman will be out.--Adieu, my lord:
+I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
+But that this folly douts it.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+King.
+Let's follow, Gertrude;
+How much I had to do to calm his rage!
+Now fear I this will give it start again;
+Therefore let's follow.
 
-What warlike noyse is this?
-Enter Osricke.
+[Exeunt.]
 
-  Osr. Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro[m] Poland
-To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly
 
-   Ham. O I dye Horatio:
-The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit,
-I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England,
-But I do prophesie th' election lights
-On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce,
-So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse,
-Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o.
 
-Dyes
+ACT V.
 
-  Hora. Now cracke a Noble heart:
-Goodnight sweet Prince,
-And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest,
-Why do's the Drumme come hither?
-Enter Fortinbras and English Ambassador, with Drumme, Colours,
-and
-Attendants.
+Scene I. A churchyard.
 
-  Fortin. Where is this sight?
-  Hor. What is it ye would see;
-If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search
-
-   For. His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death,
-What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell.
-That thou so many Princes, at a shoote,
-So bloodily hast strooke
-
-   Amb. The sight is dismall,
-And our affaires from England come too late,
-The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing,
-To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd,
-That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead:
-Where should we haue our thankes?
-  Hor. Not from his mouth,
-Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you:
-He neuer gaue command'ment for their death.
-But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question,
-You from the Polake warres, and you from England
-Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies
-High on a stage be placed to the view,
-And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world,
-How these things came about. So shall you heare
-Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts,
-Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters
-Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause,
-And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke,
-Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I
-Truly deliuer
-
-   For. Let vs hast to heare it,
-And call the Noblest to the Audience.
-For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune,
-I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome,
-Which are to claime, my vantage doth
-Inuite me,
-  Hor. Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake,
-And from his mouth
-Whose voyce will draw on more:
+[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c.]
+
+1 Clown.
+Is she to be buried in Christian burial when she wilfully
+seeks her own salvation?
+
+2 Clown.
+I tell thee she is; and therefore make her grave straight: the
+crowner hath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.
+
+1 Clown.
+How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?
+
+2 Clown.
+Why, 'tis found so.
+
+1 Clown.
+It must be se offendendo; it cannot be else. For here lies
+the point: if I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an
+act hath three branches; it is to act, to do, and to perform:
+argal, she drowned herself wittingly.
+
+2 Clown.
+Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
+
+1 Clown.
+Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here stands the
+man; good: if the man go to this water and drown himself, it is,
+will he, nill he, he goes,--mark you that: but if the water come
+to him and drown him, he drowns not himself; argal, he that is
+not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
+
+2 Clown.
+But is this law?
+
+1 Clown.
+Ay, marry, is't--crowner's quest law.
+
+2 Clown.
+Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been a
+gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o' Christian burial.
+
+1 Clown.
+Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that great folk
+should have countenance in this world to drown or hang themselves
+more than their even Christian.--Come, my spade. There is no
+ancient gentlemen but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they
+hold up Adam's profession.
+
+2 Clown.
+Was he a gentleman?
+
+1 Clown.
+He was the first that ever bore arms.
+
+2 Clown.
+Why, he had none.
+
+1 Clown.
+What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture?
+The Scripture says Adam digg'd: could he dig without arms? I'll
+put another question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
+purpose, confess thyself,--
+
+2 Clown.
+Go to.
+
+1 Clown.
+What is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the
+shipwright, or the carpenter?
+
+2 Clown.
+The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.
+
+1 Clown.
+I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows does well;
+but how does it well? it does well to those that do ill: now,
+thou dost ill to say the gallows is built stronger than the
+church; argal, the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
+
+2 Clown.
+Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?
+
+1 Clown.
+Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
+
+2 Clown.
+Marry, now I can tell.
+
+1 Clown.
+To't.
+
+2 Clown.
+Mass, I cannot tell.
+
+[Enter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.]
+
+1 Clown.
+Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will
+not mend his pace with beating; and when you are asked this
+question next, say 'a grave-maker;' the houses he makes last
+till doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan; fetch me a stoup of
+liquor.
+
+[Exit Second Clown.]
+
+[Digs and sings.]
+
+   In youth when I did love, did love,
+     Methought it was very sweet;
+   To contract, O, the time for, ah, my behove,
+     O, methought there was nothing meet.
+
+Ham.
+Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at
+grave-making?
+
+Hor.
+Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
+
+Ham.
+'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath the daintier
+sense.
+
+1 Clown.
+[Sings.]
+   But age, with his stealing steps,
+     Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
+   And hath shipp'd me into the land,
+     As if I had never been such.
+
+[Throws up a skull.]
+
+Ham.
+That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the
+knave jowls it to the ground,as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that
+did the first murder! This might be the pate of a politician,
+which this ass now o'erreaches; one that would circumvent God,
+might it not?
+
+Hor.
+It might, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Or of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord!
+How dost thou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that
+praised my lord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg
+it,--might it not?
+
+Hor.
+Ay, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked
+about the mazard with a sexton's spade: here's fine revolution,
+an we had the trick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the
+breeding but to play at loggets with 'em? mine ache to think
+on't.
+
+1 Clown.
+[Sings.]
+   A pickaxe and a spade, a spade,
+     For and a shrouding sheet;
+   O, a pit of clay for to be made
+     For such a guest is meet.
+
+[Throws up another skull].
+
+Ham.
+There's another: why may not that be the skull of a lawyer?
+Where be his quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures,
+and his tricks? why does he suffer this rude knave now to knock
+him about the sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him
+of his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be in's time a
+great buyer of land, with his statutes, his recognizances, his
+fines, his double vouchers, his recoveries: is this the fine of
+his fines, and the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
+pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him no more of
+his purchases, and double ones too, than the length and breadth
+of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his lands will
+scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself have no
+more, ha?
+
+Hor.
+Not a jot more, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+Is not parchment made of sheep-skins?
+
+Hor.
+Ay, my lord, And of calf-skins too.
+
+Ham.
+They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I
+will speak to this fellow.--Whose grave's this, sir?
+
+1 Clown.
+Mine, sir.
+[Sings.]
+   O, a pit of clay for to be made
+     For such a guest is meet.
+
+Ham.
+I think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.
+
+1 Clown.
+You lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours: for my part,
+I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.
+
+Ham.
+Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine: 'tis for
+the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
+
+1 Clown.
+'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.
+
+Ham.
+What man dost thou dig it for?
+
+1 Clown.
+For no man, sir.
+
+Ham.
+What woman then?
+
+1 Clown.
+For none neither.
+
+Ham.
+Who is to be buried in't?
+
+1 Clown.
+One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
+
+Ham.
+How absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or
+equivocation will undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three
+years I have taken note of it, the age is grown so picked that
+the toe of the peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier he
+galls his kibe.--How long hast thou been a grave-maker?
+
+1 Clown.
+Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day that our
+last King Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
+
+Ham.
+How long is that since?
+
+1 Clown.
+Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it was the
+very day that young Hamlet was born,--he that is mad, and sent
+into England.
+
+Ham.
+Ay, marry, why was be sent into England?
+
+1 Clown.
+Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits there;
+or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
+
+Ham.
+Why?
+
+1 Clown.
+'Twill not he seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.
+
+Ham.
+How came he mad?
+
+1 Clown.
+Very strangely, they say.
+
+Ham.
+How strangely?
+
+1 Clown.
+Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
+
+Ham.
+Upon what ground?
+
+1 Clown.
+Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man and boy,
+thirty years.
+
+Ham.
+How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
+
+1 Clown.
+Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,--as we have many
+pocky corses now-a-days that will scarce hold the laying in,--he
+will last you some eight year or nine year: a tanner will last
+you nine year.
+
+Ham.
+Why he more than another?
+
+1 Clown.
+Why, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will
+keep out water a great while; and your water is a sore decayer of
+your whoreson dead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain
+in the earth three-and-twenty years.
+
+Ham.
+Whose was it?
+
+1 Clown.
+A whoreson, mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
+
+Ham.
+Nay, I know not.
+
+1 Clown.
+A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! 'a pour'd a flagon of
+Rhenish on my head once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's
+skull, the king's jester.
+
+Ham.
+This?
+
+1 Clown.
+E'en that.
+
+Ham.
+Let me see. [Takes the skull.] Alas, poor Yorick!--I knew him,
+Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he
+hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred
+in my imagination it is! my gorge rises at it. Here hung those
+lips that I have kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes
+now? your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that
+were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now, to mock your
+own grinning? quite chap-fallen? Now, get you to my lady's
+chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to this
+favour she must come; make her laugh at that.--Pr'ythee, Horatio,
+tell me one thing.
+
+Hor.
+What's that, my lord?
+
+Ham.
+Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' the earth?
+
+Hor.
+E'en so.
+
+Ham.
+And smelt so? Pah!
+
+[Throws down the skull.]
+
+Hor.
+E'en so, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not
+imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander till he find it
+stopping a bung-hole?
+
+Hor.
+'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.
+
+Ham.
+No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with modesty
+enough, and likelihood to lead it: as thus: Alexander died,
+Alexander was buried, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is
+earth; of earth we make loam; and why of that loam whereto he
+was converted might they not stop a beer-barrel?
+   Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
+   Might stop a hole to keep the wind away.
+   O, that that earth which kept the world in awe
+   Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!
+But soft! but soft! aside!--Here comes the king.
+
+[Enter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia,
+Laertes, and Mourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.]
+
+The queen, the courtiers: who is that they follow?
+And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
+The corse they follow did with desperate hand
+Fordo it own life: 'twas of some estate.
+Couch we awhile and mark.
+
+[Retiring with Horatio.]
+
+Laer.
+What ceremony else?
+
+Ham.
+That is Laertes,
+A very noble youth: mark.
+
+Laer.
+What ceremony else?
+
+1 Priest.
+Her obsequies have been as far enlarg'd
+As we have warranties: her death was doubtful;
+And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
+She should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd
+Till the last trumpet; for charitable prayers,
+Shards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her,
+Yet here she is allowed her virgin rites,
+Her maiden strewments, and the bringing home
+Of bell and burial.
+
+Laer.
+Must there no more be done?
+
+1 Priest.
+No more be done;
+We should profane the service of the dead
+To sing a requiem and such rest to her
+As to peace-parted souls.
+
+Laer.
+Lay her i' the earth;--
+And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
+May violets spring!--I tell thee, churlish priest,
+A ministering angel shall my sister be
+When thou liest howling.
+
+Ham.
+What, the fair Ophelia?
+
+Queen.
+Sweets to the sweet: farewell.
+[Scattering flowers.]
+I hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
+I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
+And not have strew'd thy grave.
+
+Laer.
+O, treble woe
+Fall ten times treble on that cursed head
+Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
+Depriv'd thee of!--Hold off the earth awhile,
+Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
+[Leaps into the grave.]
+Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
+Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
+To o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head
+Of blue Olympus.
+
+Ham.
+[Advancing.]
+What is he whose grief
+Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
+Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
+Like wonder-wounded hearers? this is I,
+Hamlet the Dane.
+[Leaps into the grave.]
+
+Laer.
+The devil take thy soul!
+[Grappling with him.]
+
+Ham.
+Thou pray'st not well.
+I pr'ythee, take thy fingers from my throat;
+For, though I am not splenetive and rash,
+Yet have I in me something dangerous,
+Which let thy wiseness fear: away thy hand!
+
+King.
+Pluck them asunder.
+
+Queen.
+Hamlet! Hamlet!
+
+All.
+Gentlemen!--
+
+Hor.
+Good my lord, be quiet.
+
+[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave.]
+
+Ham.
+Why, I will fight with him upon this theme
+Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
+
+Queen.
+O my son, what theme?
+
+Ham.
+I lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers
+Could not, with all their quantity of love,
+Make up my sum.--What wilt thou do for her?
+
+King.
+O, he is mad, Laertes.
+
+Queen.
+For love of God, forbear him!
+
+Ham.
+'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
+Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
+Woul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
+I'll do't.--Dost thou come here to whine?
+To outface me with leaping in her grave?
+Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
+And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
+Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
+Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
+Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
+I'll rant as well as thou.
+
+Queen.
+This is mere madness:
+And thus a while the fit will work on him;
+Anon, as patient as the female dove,
+When that her golden couplets are disclos'd,
+His silence will sit drooping.
+
+Ham.
+Hear you, sir;
+What is the reason that you use me thus?
+I lov'd you ever: but it is no matter;
+Let Hercules himself do what he may,
+The cat will mew, and dog will have his day.
+
+[Exit.]
+
+King.
+I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.--
+
+[Exit Horatio.]
+[To Laertes]
+Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
+We'll put the matter to the present push.--
+Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.--
+This grave shall have a living monument:
+An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
+Till then in patience our proceeding be.
+
+[Exeunt.]
+
+
+
+Scene II. A hall in the Castle.
+
+[Enter Hamlet and Horatio.]
+
+Ham.
+So much for this, sir: now let me see the other;
+You do remember all the circumstance?
+
+Hor.
+Remember it, my lord!
+
+Ham.
+Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting
+That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
+Worse than the mutinies in the bilboes. Rashly,
+And prais'd be rashness for it,--let us know,
+Our indiscretion sometime serves us well,
+When our deep plots do fail; and that should teach us
+There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
+Rough-hew them how we will.
+
+Hor.
+That is most certain.
+
+Ham.
+Up from my cabin,
+My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
+Grop'd I to find out them: had my desire;
+Finger'd their packet; and, in fine, withdrew
+To mine own room again: making so bold,
+My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
+Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,
+O royal knavery! an exact command,--
+Larded with many several sorts of reasons,
+Importing Denmark's health, and England's too,
+With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,--
+That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
+No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
+My head should be struck off.
+
+Hor.
+Is't possible?
+
+Ham.
+Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
+But wilt thou bear me how I did proceed?
+
+Hor.
+I beseech you.
+
+Ham.
+Being thus benetted round with villanies,--
+Or I could make a prologue to my brains,
+They had begun the play,--I sat me down;
+Devis'd a new commission; wrote it fair:
+I once did hold it, as our statists do,
+A baseness to write fair, and labour'd much
+How to forget that learning; but, sir, now
+It did me yeoman's service. Wilt thou know
+The effect of what I wrote?
+
+Hor.
+Ay, good my lord.
+
+Ham.
+An earnest conjuration from the king,--
+As England was his faithful tributary;
+As love between them like the palm might flourish;
+As peace should still her wheaten garland wear
+And stand a comma 'tween their amities;
+And many such-like as's of great charge,--
+That, on the view and know of these contents,
+Without debatement further, more or less,
+He should the bearers put to sudden death,
+Not shriving-time allow'd.
+
+Hor.
+How was this seal'd?
+
+Ham.
+Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
+I had my father's signet in my purse,
+Which was the model of that Danish seal:
+Folded the writ up in the form of the other;
+Subscrib'd it: gave't the impression; plac'd it safely,
+The changeling never known. Now, the next day
+Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
+Thou know'st already.
+
+Hor.
+So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
+
+Ham.
+Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
+They are not near my conscience; their defeat
+Does by their own insinuation grow:
+'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
+Between the pass and fell incensed points
+Of mighty opposites.
+
+Hor.
+Why, what a king is this!
+
+Ham.
+Does it not, thinks't thee, stand me now upon,--
+He that hath kill'd my king, and whor'd my mother;
+Popp'd in between the election and my hopes;
+Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
+And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience
+To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd
+To let this canker of our nature come
+In further evil?
+
+Hor.
+It must be shortly known to him from England
+What is the issue of the business there.
+
+Ham.
+It will be short: the interim is mine;
+And a man's life is no more than to say One.
+But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
+That to Laertes I forgot myself;
+For by the image of my cause I see
+The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours:
+But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
+Into a towering passion.
+
+Hor.
+Peace; who comes here?
+
+[Enter Osric.]
+
+Osr.
+Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
+
+Ham.
+I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
+
+Hor.
+No, my good lord.
+
+Ham.
+Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him. He
+hath much land, and fertile: let a beast be lord of beasts, and
+his crib shall stand at the king's mess; 'tis a chough; but, as I
+say, spacious in the possession of dirt.
+
+Osr.
+Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I should
+impart a thing to you from his majesty.
+
+Ham.
+I will receive it with all diligence of spirit. Put your
+bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
+
+Osr.
+I thank your lordship, t'is very hot.
+
+Ham.
+No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is northerly.
+
+Osr.
+It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
+
+Ham.
+Methinks it is very sultry and hot for my complexion.
+
+Osr.
+Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as 'twere--I cannot
+tell how. But, my lord, his majesty bade me signify to you that
+he has laid a great wager on your head. Sir, this is the
+matter,--
+
+Ham.
+I beseech you, remember,--
+[Hamlet moves him to put on his hat.]
+
+Osr.
+Nay, in good faith; for mine ease, in good faith. Sir, here
+is newly come to court Laertes; believe me, an absolute
+gentleman, full of most excellent differences, of very soft
+society and great showing: indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he
+is the card or calendar of gentry; for you shall find in him the
+continent of what part a gentleman would see.
+
+Ham.
+Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;--though, I
+know, to divide him inventorially would dizzy the arithmetic of
+memory, and yet but yaw neither, in respect of his quick sail.
+But, in the verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of great
+article, and his infusion of such dearth and rareness as, to make
+true diction of him, his semblable is his mirror, and who else
+would trace him, his umbrage, nothing more.
+
+Osr.
+Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
+
+Ham.
+The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman in our more
+rawer breath?
+
+Osr.
+Sir?
+
+Hor.
+Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? You will do't,
+sir, really.
+
+Ham.
+What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
+
+Osr.
+Of Laertes?
+
+Hor.
+His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
+
+Ham.
+Of him, sir.
+
+Osr.
+I know, you are not ignorant,--
+
+Ham.
+I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, it would not
+much approve me.--Well, sir.
+
+Osr.
+You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is,--
+
+Ham.
+I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with him in
+excellence; but to know a man well were to know himself.
+
+Osr.
+I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation laid on
+him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
+
+Ham.
+What's his weapon?
+
+Osr.
+Rapier and dagger.
+
+Ham.
+That's two of his weapons:--but well.
+
+Osr.
+The king, sir, hath wager'd with him six Barbary horses:
+against the which he has imponed, as I take it, six French
+rapiers and poniards, with their assigns, as girdle, hangers, and
+so: three of the carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy,
+very responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of
+very liberal conceit.
+
+Ham.
+What call you the carriages?
+
+Hor.
+I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
+
+Osr.
+The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
+
+Ham.
+The phrase would be more german to the matter if we could
+carry cannon by our sides. I would it might be hangers till then.
+But, on: six Barbary horses against six French swords, their
+assigns, and three liberal conceited carriages: that's the French
+bet against the Danish: why is this all imponed, as you call it?
+
+Osr.
+The king, sir, hath laid that, in a dozen passes between
+your and him, he shall not exceed you three hits: he hath
+laid on twelve for nine; and it would come to immediate trial
+if your lordship would vouchsafe the answer.
+
+Ham.
+How if I answer no?
+
+Osr.
+I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
+
+Ham.
+Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his majesty,
+it is the breathing time of day with me: let the foils be
+brought, the gentleman willing, and the king hold his purpose,
+I will win for him if I can; if not, I will gain nothing but my
+shame and the odd hits.
+
+Osr.
+Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
+
+Ham.
+To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
+
+Osr.
+I commend my duty to your lordship.
+
+Ham.
+Yours, yours.
+
+[Exit Osric.]
+
+He does well to commend it himself; there are no tongues else
+for's turn.
+
+Hor.
+This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
+
+Ham.
+He did comply with his dug before he suck'd it. Thus has he,--and
+many more of the same bevy that I know the drossy age dotes on,--
+only got the tune of the time and outward habit of encounter;
+a kind of yesty collection, which carries them through and
+through the most fanned and winnowed opinions; and do but blow
+them to their trial, the bubbles are out,
+
+[Enter a Lord.]
+
+Lord.
+My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young Osric,
+who brings back to him that you attend him in the hall: he sends
+to know if your pleasure hold to play with Laertes, or that you
+will take longer time.
+
+Ham.
+I am constant to my purposes; they follow the king's pleasure:
+if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now or whensoever, provided
+I be so able as now.
+
+Lord.
+The King and Queen and all are coming down.
+
+Ham.
+In happy time.
+
+Lord.
+The queen desires you to use some gentle entertainment to
+Laertes before you fall to play.
+
+Ham.
+She well instructs me.
+
+[Exit Lord.]
+
+Hor.
+You will lose this wager, my lord.
+
+Ham.
+I do not think so; since he went into France I have been in
+continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But thou wouldst not
+think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
+
+Hor.
+Nay, good my lord,--
+
+Ham.
+It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving as
+would perhaps trouble a woman.
+
+Hor.
+If your mind dislike anything, obey it: I will forestall their
+repair hither, and say you are not fit.
+
+Ham.
+Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in
+the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come; if it be
+not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come:
+the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves,
+what is't to leave betimes?
+
+[Enter King, Queen, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with
+foils &c.]
+
+King.
+Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
+
+[The King puts Laertes' hand into Hamlet's.]
+
+Ham.
+Give me your pardon, sir: I have done you wrong:
+But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
+This presence knows, and you must needs have heard,
+How I am punish'd with sore distraction.
+What I have done
+That might your nature, honour, and exception
+Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
+Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
+If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
+And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
+Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
+Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
+Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
+His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
+Sir, in this audience,
+Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd evil
+Free me so far in your most generous thoughts
+That I have shot my arrow o'er the house
+And hurt my brother.
+
+Laer.
+I am satisfied in nature,
+Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
+To my revenge. But in my terms of honour
+I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement
+Till by some elder masters of known honour
+I have a voice and precedent of peace
+To keep my name ungor'd. But till that time
+I do receive your offer'd love like love,
+And will not wrong it.
+
+Ham.
+I embrace it freely;
+And will this brother's wager frankly play.--
+Give us the foils; come on.
+
+Laer.
+Come, one for me.
+
+Ham.
+I'll be your foil, Laertes; in mine ignorance
+Your skill shall, like a star in the darkest night,
+Stick fiery off indeed.
+
+Laer.
+You mock me, sir.
+
+Ham.
+No, by this hand.
+
+King.
+Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
+You know the wager?
+
+Ham.
+Very well, my lord;
+Your grace has laid the odds o' the weaker side.
+
+King.
+I do not fear it; I have seen you both;
+But since he's better'd, we have therefore odds.
+
+Laer.
+This is too heavy, let me see another.
+
+Ham.
+This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
+
+[They prepare to play.]
+
+Osr.
+Ay, my good lord.
+
+King.
+Set me the stoups of wine upon that table,--
+If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
+Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
+Let all the battlements their ordnance fire;
+The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
+And in the cup an union shall he throw,
+Richer than that which four successive kings
+In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
+And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
+The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
+The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
+'Now the king drinks to Hamlet.'--Come, begin:--
+And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
+
+Ham.
+Come on, sir.
+
+Laer.
+Come, my lord.
+
+[They play.]
+
+Ham.
+One.
+
+Laer.
+No.
+
+Ham.
+Judgment!
+
+Osr.
+A hit, a very palpable hit.
+
+Laer.
+Well;--again.
+
+King.
+Stay, give me drink.--Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
+Here's to thy health.--
+
+[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within.]
+
+Give him the cup.
+
+Ham.
+I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile.--
+Come.--Another hit; what say you?
+
+[They play.]
+
+Laer.
+A touch, a touch, I do confess.
+
+King.
+Our son shall win.
+
+Queen.
+He's fat, and scant of breath.--
+Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows:
+The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
+
+Ham.
+Good madam!
+
+King.
+Gertrude, do not drink.
+
+Queen.
+I will, my lord; I pray you pardon me.
+
+King.
+[Aside.] It is the poison'd cup; it is too late.
+
+Ham.
+I dare not drink yet, madam; by-and-by.
+
+Queen.
+Come, let me wipe thy face.
+
+Laer.
+My lord, I'll hit him now.
+
+King.
+I do not think't.
+
+Laer.
+[Aside.] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
+
+Ham.
+Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
+I pray you pass with your best violence:
+I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
+
+Laer.
+Say you so? come on.
+
+[They play.]
+
+Osr.
+Nothing, neither way.
+
+Laer.
+Have at you now!
+
+[Laertes wounds Hamlet; then, in scuffling, they
+change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds Laertes.]
+
+King.
+Part them; they are incens'd.
+
+Ham.
+Nay, come again!
+
+[The Queen falls.]
+
+Osr.
+Look to the queen there, ho!
+
+Hor.
+They bleed on both sides.--How is it, my lord?
+
+Osr.
+How is't, Laertes?
+
+Laer.
+Why, as a woodcock to my own springe, Osric;
+I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
+
+Ham.
+How does the Queen?
+
+King.
+She swoons to see them bleed.
+
+Queen.
+No, no! the drink, the drink!--O my dear Hamlet!--
+The drink, the drink!--I am poison'd.
+
+[Dies.]
+
+Ham.
+O villany!--Ho! let the door be lock'd:
+Treachery! seek it out.
+
+[Laertes falls.]
+
+Laer.
+It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
+No medicine in the world can do thee good;
+In thee there is not half an hour of life;
+The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
+Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practice
+Hath turn'd itself on me; lo, here I lie,
+Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
+I can no more:--the king, the king's to blame.
+
+Ham.
+The point envenom'd too!--
+Then, venom, to thy work.
+
+[Stabs the King.]
+
+Osric and Lords.
+Treason! treason!
+
+King.
+O, yet defend me, friends! I am but hurt.
+
+Ham.
+Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
+Drink off this potion.--Is thy union here?
+Follow my mother.
+
+[King dies.]
+
+Laer.
+He is justly serv'd;
+It is a poison temper'd by himself.--
+Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
+Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
+Nor thine on me!
+
+[Dies.]
+
+Ham.
+Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.--
+I am dead, Horatio.--Wretched queen, adieu!--
+You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
+That are but mutes or audience to this act,
+Had I but time,--as this fell sergeant, death,
+Is strict in his arrest,--O, I could tell you,--
+But let it be.--Horatio, I am dead;
+Thou liv'st; report me and my cause aright
+To the unsatisfied.
+
+Hor.
+Never believe it:
+I am more an antique Roman than a Dane.--
+Here's yet some liquor left.
+
+Ham.
+As thou'rt a man,
+Give me the cup; let go; by heaven, I'll have't.--
+O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
+Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
+If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart,
+Absent thee from felicity awhile,
+And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
+To tell my story.--
+
+[March afar off, and shot within.]
+
+What warlike noise is this?
+
+Osr.
+Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
+To the ambassadors of England gives
+This warlike volley.
+
+Ham.
+O, I die, Horatio;
+The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
+I cannot live to hear the news from England;
+But I do prophesy the election lights
+On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
+So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
+Which have solicited.--the rest is silence.
+
+[Dies.]
+
+Hor.
+Now cracks a noble heart.--Good night, sweet prince,
+And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
+Why does the drum come hither?
+
+[March within.]
+
+[Enter Fortinbras, the English Ambassadors, and others.]
+
+Fort.
+Where is this sight?
+
+Hor.
+What is it you will see?
+If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
+
+Fort.
+This quarry cries on havoc.--O proud death,
+What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
+That thou so many princes at a shot
+So bloodily hast struck?
+
+1 Ambassador.
+The sight is dismal;
+And our affairs from England come too late:
+The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
+To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd
+That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
+Where should we have our thanks?
+
+Hor.
+Not from his mouth,
+Had it the ability of life to thank you:
+He never gave commandment for their death.
+But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
+You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
+Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
+High on a stage be placed to the view;
+And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
+How these things came about: so shall you hear
+Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
+Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
+Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
+And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
+Fall'n on the inventors' heads: all this can I
+Truly deliver.
+
+Fort.
+Let us haste to hear it,
+And call the noblest to the audience.
+For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
+I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
+Which now, to claim my vantage doth invite me.
+
+Hor.
+Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
+And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more:
 But let this same be presently perform'd,
-Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde,
-Lest more mischance
-On plots, and errors happen
-
-   For. Let foure Captaines
-Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage,
-For he was likely, had he beene put on
-To haue prou'd most royally:
-And for his passage,
-The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre
-Speake lowdly for him.
-Take vp the body; Such a sight as this
-Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis.
-Go, bid the Souldiers shoote.
+Even while men's minds are wild: lest more mischance
+On plots and errors happen.
 
-Exeunt. Marching: after the which, a Peale of Ordenance are shot
-off.
+Fort.
+Let four captains
+Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
+For he was likely, had he been put on,
+To have prov'd most royally: and, for his passage,
+The soldiers' music and the rites of war
+Speak loudly for him.--
+Take up the bodies.--Such a sight as this
+Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
+Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
 
+[A dead march.]
 
-FINIS. The tragedie of HAMLET, Prince of Denmarke.
+[Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after the which a peal of
+ordnance is shot off.]
